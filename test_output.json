If the wall outlet has its' own GFCI protection I could simply unplug the original male end of the charging cord and then plug the cord into the wall. I emailed Tesla about this a few days ago (re: the Model S, but the same thing applies): Tesla said to not install a GFCI on the circuit. The simplest and quickest fix (and no messing with live circuits) is to remove the GFCI from the cord and replace it with an industrial grade straight plug, as has been discussed in other threads in this forum.",

      "body": "Hey Tesla community, I have a quick question about pre-conditioning the battery on my Model Y. You never need to precondition the battery (fall, winter, spring or summer.) The Tesla Model Y's battery management system will automatically warm or cool the battery as required. The Tesla Model Y may start to precondition the battery for optimal Supercharging when your Model Y is still a good 30 minutes/30 miles away from the Supercharger location (when on a road trip.) (5 minutes is not enough time.) I have observed that the Tesla Model may perform some battery warming while Supercharging to improve the efficiency and speed of the Supercharging session. This affords plenty of time for the Tesla Model Y to fully precondition the battery for next Supercharger charging session.",

Given that I really care about the self-driving, I decided to cancel my order completely and wait for the new hardware upgrade. Prior to the cancellation, I had wired the total payment of the car to Tesla. I'm just really concerned because I got a confirmation email for returning the floor mats but I'm not getting a confirmation email for the car that I have paid a lot of money for. That said, given there is zero concrete evidence of HW5, it could be years before you can buy a car with it.",
