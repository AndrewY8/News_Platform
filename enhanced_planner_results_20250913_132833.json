I emailed Tesla about this a few days ago (re: the Model S, but the same thing applies): Tesla said to not install a GFCI on the circuit.

      "body": "Hey Tesla community, I have a quick question about pre-conditioning the battery on my Model Y. You never need to precondition the battery (fall, winter, spring or summer.) The Tesla Model Y's battery management system will automatically warm or cool the battery as required. The Tesla Model Y may start to precondition the battery for optimal Supercharging when your Model Y is still a good 30 minutes/30 miles away from the Supercharger location (when on a road trip.) (5 minutes is not enough time.) I have observed that the Tesla Model may perform some battery warming while Supercharging to improve the efficiency and speed of the Supercharging session. This affords plenty of time for the Tesla Model Y to fully precondition the battery for next Supercharger charging session.",
