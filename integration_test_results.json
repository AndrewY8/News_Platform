Generative AI is experimental.\nShare\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nMail\nCopy link\nAs we move into 2025, we wanted to take a moment to recognize the astonishing progress of the last year. From\nnew Gemini models built for the agentic era\nand empowering\ncreativity\n, to an\nAI system\nthat designs novel, high-strength protein binders,\nAI\u2013enabled neuroscience\nand even\nlandmark advances\nin quantum computing, we\u2019ve been boldly and responsibly advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence and all the ways it can benefit humanity.\nAs we and our colleagues\nwrote\ntwo years ago in an essay titled\nWhy we focus on AI\n:\n\u201c\nOur approach to developing and harnessing the potential of AI is grounded in our founding mission \u2014 to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful \u2014 and it is shaped by our commitment to improve the lives of as many people as possible\n.\u201d\nThis remains as true today as it was when we first wrote it.\nIn this 2024 Year-in-Review post, we look back on a year's worth of extraordinary progress in AI, made possible by the many incredible teams across Google, that helped deliver on that mission and commitment \u2014 progress that sets the stage for more to come this year.\nRelentless innovation in models, products and technologies\n2024 was a year of experimenting, fast shipping, and putting our latest technologies in the hands of developers.\nIn December 2024, we released the first models in our\nGemini 2.0\nexperimental series \u2014 AI models designed for the agentic era. First out of the gate was Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model, followed by prototypes from the frontiers of our agentic research including: an updated\nProject Astra\n, which explores the capabilities of a universal AI assistant;\nProject Mariner\n, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension; and\nJules\n, an AI-powered code agent. We're looking forward to bringing Gemini 2.0\u2019s powerful capabilities to our flagship products \u2014 in Search, we\u2019ve already started testing in\nAI Overviews\n, which are now used by over a billion people to ask new types of questions.\nWe also released\nDeep Research\n, a new agentic feature in Gemini Advanced that saves people hours of research work by creating and executing multi-step plans for finding answers to complicated questions; and introduced\nGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental\n, an experimental model that explicitly shows its thoughts.\nThese advances followed swift progress earlier in the year, from incorporating\nGemini\u2019s capabilities into more Google products\nto the release of\nGemini 1.5 Pro\nand\nGemini 1.5 Flash\n\u2014 a model optimized for speed and efficiency. 1.5 Flash\u2019s compact size made it more cost-efficient to serve, and in 2024 it became our most popular model for developers.\nAnd we improved and updated\nAI Studio\n, which provides a host of resources for developers. It is now available as a progressive web app (PWA) that can be installed on desktop, iOS and Android.\nNotably, it\u2019s been exciting to see the public reception to several\nnew features\nfor NotebookLM, such as Audio Overviews, which can take uploaded source material and produce a\n\u201cdeep dive\u201d discussion\nbetween\ntwo AI hosts\n.\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\nNotebookLM Audio Overview\nIn this Audio Overview, two AI hosts dive into the world of NotebookLM updates.\nMore natural and intuitive handling of speech input and output remains at the core of several of our products:\nGemini Live\n,\nProject Astra\n,\nJourney Voices\nand\nYouTube\u2019s auto dubbing\n.\nContinuing our long history of contributing innovations to the open community \u2014\u00a0such as with\nTransformers\n,\nTensorFlow\n,\nBERT\n,\nT5\n,\nJAX\n,\nAlphaFold\nand\nAlphaCode\n\u2014 we released two new models from\nGemma\n, our state-of-the-art open model built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma\noutperformed\nsimilarly sized open models on capabilities like question answering, reasoning, math / science and coding. And we released\nGemma Scope\n, which provides tools that help researchers understand the inner workings of Gemma 2.\nWe also continued to improve the factuality of our models and minimize hallucinations. In December, for example, we published\nFACTS Grounding\n, a new benchmark \u2014 based on collaboration between Google DeepMind, Google Research and Kaggle \u2014 for evaluating how accurately large language models ground their responses in provided source material and avoid hallucinations.\nThe FACTS Grounding dataset comprises 1,719 examples, each carefully crafted to require long-form responses grounded in the context document provided.\nWe tested leading LLMs using FACTS Grounding, launched the\nFACTS leaderboard\non Kaggle and are proud that Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro currently have the three highest factuality scores, with gemini-2.0-flash-exp at 83.6%.\nMoreover, we improved underlying ML efficiency through pioneering\ntechniques\nlike\nblockwise parallel decoding\n,\nimproved confidence-based deferral\nand\nspeculative decoding\nthat reduce the inference times of LLMs, allowing them to generate responses more quickly. These improvements are used across Google products and set a standard throughout the industry.\nCombining AI with sport, in March we released\nTacticAI\n, an AI system for football tactics that can provide experts with tactical insights, particularly on corner kicks.\nUnderlying all of our models and products is our ongoing commitment to research leadership. Indeed, in a\n2010-2023 WIPO survey of citations for papers on Generative AI\n, Google including Google Research and Google DeepMind\u2019s citations were more than double the second-most cited institution.\nThis WIPO graph, based on January 2024 data from The Lens, illustrates more than a decade\u2019s worth of Alphabet\u2019s generative AI scientific publication efforts.\nFinally, progress was made with Project Starline, our \u201cmagic window\u201d technology project that enables friends, families and coworkers to feel like they\u2019re together from any distance. We\npartnered with HP\nto start commercialization, with the goal of enabling it directly from video conferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom.\nEmpowering creative vision with generative AI\nWe believe AI holds great potential to enable new forms of creativity, democratize creative output and help people express their artistic visions. This is why last year we introduced a series of updates across our generative media tools, covering images, music and video.\nAt the start of 2024, we\nintroduced\nImageFX, a new generative AI tool that creates images from text prompts, and MusicFX, a tool for creating up-to-70-second audio clips also based on text prompts. At I/O, we\nshared an early preview\nof MusicFX DJ, a tool that helps bring the joy of live music creation to more people. In October, we collaborated with\nJacob Collier\non making MusicFX DJ simpler to use, especially for new or aspiring musicians. And we updated our music AI toolkit\nMusic AI Sandbox\n, and evolved our\nDream Track experiment\nwhich allowed U.S. creators to explore a range of genres and prompts that generate instrumental soundtracks with powerful text-to-music models.\nLater in 2024, we released state-of-the-art updates to our image and video models:\nVeo 2\nand\nImagen 3\n. As our highest quality text-to-image model, Imagen 3 is capable of generating images with even better detail, richer lighting and fewer distracting artifacts than our previous models; while Veo demonstrated an improved understanding of real-world physics and the nuances of human movement and expression alongside its overall attention-to-detail and realism.\nVeo represents a significant step forward in high-quality video generation.\nResearch in this field continued apace. We explored ways to use AI to improve editing, for example by\nusing it\nto control of attributes like transparency, roughness or other physical properties of objects:\nIn these examples of AI editing with synthetic data generation, Input shows a novel, held-out image the model has never seen before. Output shows the model output, which successfully edits material properties.\nIn the field of\naudio generation\n, we announced improvements to video-to-audio (V2A) technology, which can generate dynamic soundscapes through natural language text prompts based on on-screen action. This technology is pairable with AI-created video through\nVeo\n.\nGames are an ideal environment for creative exploration of new worlds, as well as training and evaluating embodied agents. In 2024, we introduced\nGenie 2\n, a foundation world model capable of generating an endless variety of action-controllable, playable 3D environments for training and evaluating embodied agents. This followed the\nintroduction of SIMA\n, a Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent that can follow natural-language instructions to carry out tasks in a variety of video game settings.\nThe architecture of intelligence: advances in robotics, hardware and computing\nAs our multimodal models become more capable and gain a better understanding of the world and its physics, they are making possible incredible new advances in robotics and bringing us closer to our goal of ever-more capable and helpful robots.\nWith ALOHA Unleashed, our robot learned to tie a shoelace, hang a shirt, repair another robot, insert a gear and even clean a kitchen.\nAt the beginning of the year, we\nintroduced\nAutoRT, SARA-RT and RT-Trajectory, extensions of our\nRobotics Transformers\nwork intended to help robots better understand and navigate their environments, and make decisions faster. We also published\nALOHA Unleashed\n, a breakthrough in teaching robots on how to use two robotic arms in coordination, and\nDemoStart\n, which uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve real-world performance on a multi-fingered robotic hand by using simulations.\nRobotic Transformer 2 (RT-2) is a novel vision-language-action model that learns from both web and robotics data.\nBeyond robotics, our\nAlphaChip\nreinforcement learning method for accelerating and improving chip floorplanning is transforming the design process for chips found in data centers, smartphones and more. To accelerate adoption of these techniques, we released a\npre-trained checkpoint\nto enable external parties to more easily make use of the\nAlphaChip open source release\nfor their own chip designs. And we made\nTrillium\n, our sixth-generation and most performant TPU to date, generally available to Google Cloud customers. Advances in computer chips have accelerated AI. And now, AI can return the favor.\nAlphaChip can learn the relationships between interconnected chip components and generalize across chips, letting AlphaChip improve with each layout it designs.\nOur research also focused on correcting the errors in the physical hardware of today's quantum computers. In November, we launched\nAlphaQubit\n, an AI-based decoder that identifies quantum computing errors with state-of-the-art accuracy. This collaborative work brought together Google DeepMind\u2019s ML knowledge and Google Research\u2019s error correction expertise to accelerate progress on building a reliable quantum computer. In tests, it made 6% fewer errors than tensor network methods and 30% fewer errors than correlated matching.\nThen in December, the Google Quantum AI team, part of Google Research, announced\nWillow\n, our latest quantum chip which can perform in under five minutes a benchmark computation that would take one of today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years. Willow can reduce errors exponentially as it scales up using more qubits. In fact, it used our quantum error correction to cut the error rate in half, solving a 30+ year challenge known in the field as \u201cbelow threshold.\u201d This leap forward won the\nPhysics Breakthrough of the Year\naward.\nWillow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics.\nUncovering new solutions: progress in science, biology and mathematics\nWe continued to push the envelope on accelerating scientific progress with AI-based approaches, releasing a series of tools and papers this year that showed just how useful and powerful a tool AI is for advancing science and mathematics. We're sharing a few highlights.\nIn January, we introduced\nAlphaGeometry\n, an AI system engineered to solve complex geometry problems. Our updated version, AlphaGeometry 2, and AlphaProof, a reinforcement-learning-based system for formal math reasoning,\nachieved the same level as a silver medalist\nin July 2024\u2019s\nInternational Mathematical Olympiad\n.\nAlphaGeometry 2 solved Problem 4 in July 2024\u2019s International Mathematical Olympiad within 19 seconds after receiving its formalization. Problem 4 asked to prove the sum of \u2220KIL and \u2220XPY equals 180\u00b0.\nIn collaboration with Isomorphic Labs, we introduced\nAlphaFold 3\n, our latest model which predicts the structure and interactions of all of life\u2019s molecules. By accurately predicting the structure of proteins, DNA, RNA, ligands and more, and how they interact, we hope it will transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery.\nAlphaFold 3\u2019s capabilities come from its next-generation architecture and training that now covers all of life\u2019s molecules.\nWe made several key developments in protein-shaping. We announced\nAlphaProteo\n, an AI system for designing novel, high-strength protein binders. AlphaProteo can lead to the discovery of new drugs, the development of biosensors and improve our understanding of biological processes.\nAlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins.\nIn collaboration with Harvard\u2019s Lichtman Lab and others, we\nproduced\na nano-scale mapping of a piece of the human brain at a level of detail never previously achieved, and made it publicly available for researchers to build on. This follows\na decade of working to advance our understanding of connectomics\n, with earlier work on fly brain and mouse brain connectomics now giving way to the larger scale and more complex human brain connectomics.\nIn the deepest layer of the cortex, clusters of cells tend to occur in mirror-image orientation to one another, as shown in this brain mapping project.\nThen in late November, as part of a\nbroader effort\nto expand and deepen public dialogue around science and AI, we co-hosted\nthe AI for Science Forum\nwith the Royal Society, which convened\nscientists\n, researchers, governmental leaders and executives to discuss\nkey topics\nlike cracking the protein structure prediction challenge, mapping the human brain and saving lives through accurate forecasting and spotting wildfires. We hosted a Q&A with the four Nobel Laureates in attendance at the forum, Sir Paul Nurse, Jennifer Doudna, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, which is available to listen to via the Google DeepMind\npodcast\n.\nThis was also a landmark year for another reason: Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, along with David Baker, were awarded the\n2024 Nobel Prize\u00ae in Chemistry\nfor their work on AlphaFold 2. As the Nobel committee\nrecognized\n, their work:\n\"[H]as opened up completely new possibilities to design proteins that have never been seen before, and we now have access to predicted structures of all 200 million known proteins. These are truly great achievements.\"\nIt was also exciting to see the\n2024 Nobel Prize\u00ae in Physics\nawarded to recently retired long-time Googler Geoffrey Hinton (along with John Hopfield), \"for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.\u201d\nThe Nobels followed additional recognitions for Google including the\nNeurIPS 2024 Test of Time Paper Awards\nfor\nSequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\nand\nGenerative Adversarial Nets\n, and the\nBeale\u2014Orchard-Hays Prize\n, which was awarded to a collaborative team of educators and Google professionals for groundbreaking work on\nPrimal-Dual Linear Programming (PDLP)\n. (PDLP, now part of\nGoogle OR Tools\n, helps solve large-scale linear programming problems with real-world applications from\ndata center network traffic engineering\nto\ncontainer shipping optimization\n.)\nAI for the benefit of humanity\nThis year, we made a number of product advances and published research that showed how AI can benefit people directly and immediately, ranging from preventative and diagnostic medicine to disaster readiness and recovery to learning.\nIn healthcare, AI holds the promise of democratizing quality of care in key areas, such as early\ndetection of cardiovascular disease\n. Our\nresearch\ndemonstrated how using a simple fingertip device that measures variations in blood flow, combined with basic metadata, can predict heart health risks. We built on previous AI-enabled diagnostic research for tuberculosis,\ndemonstrating\nhow AI models can be used for accurate TB screenings in populations with high rates of TB and HIV. This is important to reducing the prevalence of TB (more than\n10 million people\nfall ill with it each year), as roughly 40% of people with TB go\nundiagnosed\n.\nOn the MedQA (USMLE-style) benchmark, Med-Gemini attains a new state-of-the-art score, surpassing our prior best (\nMed-PaLM 2\n) by a significant margin of 4.6%.\nOur Gemini model is a powerful tool for professionals generally, but our teams are also working to create fine-tuned models for other domains. For example, we introduced\nMed-Gemini\n, a new family of next-generation models that combine training on de-identified medical data with Gemini\u2019s reasoning, multimodal and long-context abilities. On the MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini\nachieves\na state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown above).\nWe are exploring how machine learning can help medical fields struggling with access to imaging expertise, such as\nradiology, dermatology and pathology\n. In the past year, we\nreleased\ntwo research tools,\nDerm Foundation\nand\nPath Foundation\n, that can help develop models for diagnostic tasks, image indexing and curation and biomarker discovery and validation. We collaborated with physicians at Stanford Medicine on an open-access, inclusive\nSkin Condition Image Network (SCIN) dataset\n. And we unveiled\nCT Foundation\n, a medical imaging embedding tool used for rapidly training models for research.\nWith regard to learning, we explored new generative AI tools to support educators and learners. We introduced\nLearnLM\n, our new family of models fine-tuned for learning and used it to enhance learning experiences in products like Search, YouTube and Gemini; a recent report showed LearnLM\noutperformed\nother leading AI models. We also\nmade it available\nto developers as an experimental model in AI Studio. Our new conversational learning companion,\nLearnAbout\n, uses AI to help you dive deeper into any topic you\u2019re curious about, while\nIlluminate\nlets you turn content into engaging AI-generated audio discussions.\nIn the fields of disaster forecasting and preparedness, we announced several breakthroughs. We introduced\nGenCast\n, our new high-resolution AI ensemble model, which improves day-to-day weather and extreme events forecasting across all possible weather trajectories. We also introduced our\nNeuralGCM model\n, able to simulate over 70,000 days of the atmosphere in the time it would take a physics-based model to simulate only 19 days. And\nGraphCast\nwon the\n2024 MacRobert Award\nfor engineering innovation.\nThis selection of GraphCast\u2019s predictions rolling across 10 days shows specific humidity at 700 hectopascals (about 3 kilometers above surface), surface temperature and surface wind speed.\nWe also improved our\nflood forecasting model\nto predict flooding seven days in advance (up from five) and expanded our riverine flood forecasting coverage to 100 countries and 700 million people. This marks a significant milestone in a multi-year initiative that Google Research embarked on in 2018.\nOur flood forecasting model is now available in over 100 countries (left), and we now have \u201cvirtual gauges\u201d for experts and researchers in more than 150 countries, including countries where physical gauges are not available.\nAI can also help with wildfire detection and mitigation, which is especially top of mind given the devastation in California. Our\nWildfire Boundary Maps capabilities\nare now available in 22 countries. Alongside leading wildfire authorities, Google Research also created\nFireSat\n, a constellation of satellites that can detect and track wildfires as small as a classroom (roughly 5x5 meters) within 20 minutes.\nAnd we continued building on our commitment to making more information more accessible to more people,\nexpanding Google Translate\nwith 110 new languages, including Cantonese, Papua New Guinea\u2019s Tok Pisin, N\u2019Ko from West Africa and Manx from the Isle of Man. Google Translate \u2014 which now supports over 240 languages \u2014 can help people overcome barriers to information, knowledge and opportunity.\nThese new languages in Google Translate represent more than 614 million speakers, opening up translations for around 8% of the world\u2019s population.\nHelping set the standard in responsible AI\nWe furthered our industry-leading research in AI safety, developing new tools and techniques and integrating these advances into our latest models. We\u2019re committed to working with others to address risks.\nWe continued\nresearching\nmisuse, conducting a study that found the two most common types of misuse were deep fakes and jailbreaks. In May, we introduced\nThe Frontier Safety Framework\n, which established protocols for identifying the emerging capabilities of our most advanced AI models, and launched our\nAI Responsibility Lifecycle framework\nto the public. In October, we\nexpanded\nour\nResponsible GenAI Toolkit\nto work with any LLM, giving developers more tools to build AI responsibly.\nAnd, among our other efforts, we released a paper this year on\nThe Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants\nthat examined and mapped the new technical and moral landscape of a future populated by AI assistants, and characterized the opportunities and risks society might face.\nWe expanded\nSynthID\u2019s capabilities\nto watermarking AI-generated text in the\nGemini app and web experience\n, and video in\nVeo\n. To help increase overall transparency online, not just with content created by Google gen AI tools, we also\njoined\nthe Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) as a steering committee member and\ncollaborated\non a new, more secure version of the technical standard, Content Credentials.\nWhen there\u2019s a range of different tokens to choose from, SynthID can adjust the probability score of each predicted token, in cases where it won\u2019t compromise the quality, accuracy and creativity of the output.\nBeyond LLMs, we shared our approach to\nbiosecurity\nfor\nAlphaFold 3\n. We also worked with industry partners to launch the\nCoalition for Secure AI\n(CoSAI), and we participated in the\nAI Seoul Summit\n, as a way of building and contributing to an international consensus and a common, coordinated approach to governance.\nAs we develop new technologies like AI agents, we\u2019ll continue to encounter new questions around safety, security and privacy. Guided by our\nAI Principles\n, we are\ndeliberately taking\nan exploratory and gradual approach to development, conducting research on multiple prototypes, iteratively implementing safety training, working with trusted testers and external experts and performing extensive risk assessments and safety and assurance evaluations.\nLooking ahead to 2025\n2024 was a productive year, and a very exciting time for groundbreaking new products and research in AI. We made a great deal of progress and we\u2019re even more excited about the year ahead.\nAs we continue to produce groundbreaking AI research in the fields of products, science, health, creativity and more, it becomes increasingly important to think deeply about how and when it should be deployed. By continuing to prioritize responsible AI practices and fostering collaboration, we\u2019ll play an important role in building a future where AI benefits humanity.\nPOSTED IN:\nRelated stories\nGoogle Workspace\nHow AI made Meet\u2019s language translation possible\nBy\nMolly McHugh-Johnson\nSep 11, 2025\nAI\nThe latest AI news we announced in August\nBy\nKeyword Team\nSep 10, 2025\nLearning & Education\nAI Quests: Bringing AI literacy to the classroom\nBy\nRonit Levavi Morad\nSep 09, 2025\nAI\nThe latest Google AI literacy resources all in one place\nBy\nJennie Magiera\nResearch\nGoogle Quantum AI has been selected for the DARPA Quantum Benchmarking Initiative.\nBy\nHartmut Neven\nSep 09, 2025\nSearch\nGoogle Doodles show how AI Mode can help you learn.\nSep 08, 2025\n.\nJump to position 1\nJump to position 2\nJump to position 3\nJump to position 4\nJump to position 5\nJump to position 6\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.

Generative AI is experimental.\nExplore other styles:\nGeneral summary\nBullet points\nShare\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nMail\nCopy link\nLast updated: November 22, 2024\nWe\u2019re living in a time when applied science, human ingenuity and new technologies are offering deep insights into some of humanity\u2019s biggest (and oldest) questions. While we often think of scientific progress as fast and unrelenting, for many decades, progress has\nactually slowed\n. While the scientific community continues to debate the cause of this slowdown, much of today's technology \u2014 from jets to manufacturing processes \u2014 is not significantly different than half a century ago.\nBut in just the past few years, breakthroughs in formerly nascent fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing have dramatically accelerated the pace of scientific discovery. And from healthcare advances to finding plastic-eating enzymes, we\u2019re already benefiting from it.\nThese breakthroughs are built on decades of collaboration between researchers, technologists, policymakers, civil organizations and many people from across society. And they offer a blueprint for how applying AI to science can dramatically improve human life.\nIt\u2019s with this in mind that today The Royal Society in partnership with Google DeepMind is cohosting the first AI for Science Forum. This event in London brings together the scientific community, policymakers, and industry leaders to look at the transformative potential of AI to accelerate science and the role of public-private partnerships in innovation.\nTo explore how we got here and where we can go next, here\u2019s a look at nine recent moments that have set the stage for so much of the scientific progress on the horizon:\n1. Cracking the 50-year \u201cgrand challenge\u201d of protein structure prediction\nExperts have described demystifying protein folding as a \"grand challenge\" for decades. In 2022, Google DeepMind shared the predicted structures of 200 million proteins from their\nAlphaFold 2 model\n. Previously, determining the 3D structure of a single protein typically took a year or more \u2014 AlphaFold can predict these shapes with remarkable accuracy in minutes. By releasing the protein structure predictions in\na free database\n, this has enabled scientists around the world to accelerate progress in areas like developing\nnew medicines\n,\nfighting antibiotic resistance\nand\ntackling plastic pollution\n. As a next step,\nthe AlphaFold 3 model builds on AlphaFold 2 to predict the structure and interaction\nof all of life\u2019s molecules.\n2. Showing the human brain in unprecedented detail, to support health research\nFew things have held more mystery throughout time than the human brain. Developed over 10 years of\nconnectomics\nresearch,\nGoogle partnered with others, including the the Lichtman Lab at Harvard\n, to map a tiny piece of the human brain to a level of detail never previously achieved. This project, released in 2024, revealed never-before-seen structures within the human brain. And the full dataset, including AI-generated annotations for each cell, has been made publicly available to help accelerate research.\n3. Saving lives with accurate flood forecasting\nWhen Google\u2019s flood forecasting project\nbegan in 2018\n, many believed it was impossible to accurately deliver flood forecasting at scale, given the scarcity of data. But researchers were able to develop an AI model that achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time with reliability matching or exceeding that of nowcasts (zero-day lead time). In 2024, Google Research expanded this coverage to\n100 countries and 700 million people worldwide\n\u2014 and improved the AI model so it offers the same accuracy at a seven-day lead time as the previous model had at five.\n4. Spotting wildfires earlier to help firefighters stop them faster\nWildfires are increasingly upending communities around the world due to hotter and drier climates. In 2024,\nGoogle Research partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to develop FireSat\n, an AI model and new global satellite constellation designed specifically to detect and track wildfires the size of a classroom by providing higher-resolution imagery within 20 minutes. This will allow fire authorities to respond more quickly, potentially saving lives, property and natural resources.\n5. Predicting weather faster and with more accuracy\nIn 2023, Google DeepMind launched and open sourced the model code for\nGraphCast\n, a machine learning research model that predicts weather conditions up to 10 days in advance more accurately and much faster than the industry gold-standard weather simulation system (HRES). GraphCast can also predict the tracks of cyclones (and associated risks like flooding) with greater accuracy,\nand accurately predicted Hurricane Lee\nwould hit Nova Scotia three days before traditional models.\n6. Advancing the frontier of mathematical reasoning\nAI has always struggled with complex math due to a lack of data and reasoning skills. Then, in 2024, Google DeepMind announced\nAlphaGeometry\n, an AI system that solved complex geometry problems at a level approaching a human Olympiad gold-medalist \u2014 a breakthrough in AI performance and the pursuit of more advanced general AI systems. The subsequent Gemini-trained model,\nAlphaGeometry 2, was then combined with a new model AlphaProof\n, and together they solved 83% of all historical International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) geometry problems from the past 25 years. In demonstrating AI\u2019s growing ability to reason, and potentially solve problems beyond current human abilities, this moved us closer to systems that can discover and verify new knowledge.\n7. Using quantum computing to accurately predict chemical reactivity and kinetics\nGoogle researchers worked with UC Berkeley and Columbia University to perform the largest chemistry simulations to date on a quantum computer. The results,\npublished in 2022\n, were not only competitive with classical methods, but they also did not require the burdensome error mitigation typically associated with quantum computing. The ability to conduct these simulations will offer even more accurate predictions of chemical reactivity and kinetics, which is a precursor for applying chemistry in new ways to help solve real-world challenges.\n8. Accelerating materials science and the potential for more sustainable solar cells, batteries and superconductors\nIn 2023, Google DeepMind announced Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (\nGNoME)\n, a new AI tool that has already discovered 380,000 materials that are stable at low temperatures, according to simulations. At a time when our world is looking for new approaches to energy, processing power and materials science, this work could pave the way to\nbetter solar cells, batteries\nand potential superconductors. Plus, to help this technology benefit everyone, Google DeepMind made GNoME\u2019s most stable predictions available via the Materials Project on their open database.\n9. Taking a meaningful step toward nuclear fusion \u2014 and abundant clean energy\nAs the old joke goes, \u201cFusion is the energy of the future \u2014 and it always will be.\u201d Controlling and using the energy that fuels stars (including our own sun) has been beyond the realm of science. In 2022,\nGoogle DeepMind announced\nthat it developed AI that can\ncontrol the plasma inside a nuclear fusion reactor\nautonomously. By collaborating with the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL, Google DeepMind built the first Reinforcement Learned system capable of autonomously stabilizing and shaping the plasma within an operational fusion reactor, opening up new pathways toward stable fusion and abundant clean energy for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nRelated stories\nGoogle Workspace\nHow AI made Meet\u2019s language translation possible\nBy\nMolly McHugh-Johnson\nSep 11, 2025\nAI\nThe latest AI news we announced in August\nBy\nKeyword Team\nSep 10, 2025\nSustainability\nGoogle is fighting water leaks in Belgium.\nBy\nBen Townsend\nSep 10, 2025\nLearning & Education\nAI Quests: Bringing AI literacy to the classroom\nBy\nRonit Levavi Morad\nSep 09, 2025\nAI\nThe latest Google AI literacy resources all in one place\nBy\nJennie Magiera\nResearch\nGoogle Quantum AI has been selected for the DARPA Quantum Benchmarking Initiative.\nBy\nHartmut Neven\nSep 09, 2025\n.\nJump to position 1\nJump to position 2\nJump to position 3\nJump to position 4\nJump to position 5\nJump to position 6\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.

In this example, we'll extract all paragraph (<p>) text from the main content section of the GeeksforGeeks Python Tutorial page. To handle this, we use Selenium that can automate browsers like Chrome or Firefox, wait for content to load, click buttons, scroll and extract fully rendered web pages just like a real user. The urllib module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for working with URLs. It allows you to interact with web pages by fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), opening and reading data from them and performing other URL-related tasks like encoding and parsing."

Web scraping is a powerful tool for data collection and analysis. By working through this quiz, you'll revisit how to parse website data using string methods, regular expressions, and HTML parsers, as well as how to interact with forms and other website components.\nScrape and Parse Text From Websites\nCollecting data from websites using an automated process is known as web scraping. Some websites explicitly forbid users from scraping their data with automated tools like the ones that you\u2019ll create in this tutorial. Websites do this for two possible reasons:\nThe site has a good reason to protect its data. For instance, Google Maps doesn\u2019t let you request too many results too quickly.\nMaking many repeated requests to a website\u2019s server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website for other users and potentially overloading the server such that the website stops responding entirely.\nBefore using your Python skills for web scraping, you should always check your target website\u2019s acceptable use policy to see if accessing the website with automated tools is a violation of its terms of use. Legally, web scraping against the wishes of a website is very much a gray area.\nImportant:\nPlease be aware that the following techniques\nmay be illegal\nwhen used on websites that prohibit web scraping.\nFor this tutorial, you\u2019ll use a page that\u2019s hosted on Real Python\u2019s server. The page that you\u2019ll access has been set up for use with this tutorial.\nNow that you\u2019ve read the disclaimer, you can get to the fun stuff. In the next section, you\u2019ll start grabbing all the HTML code from a single web page.\nRemove ads\nBuild Your First Web Scraper\nOne useful package for web scraping that you can find in Python\u2019s\nstandard library\nis\nurllib\n, which contains tools for working with URLs. In particular, the\nurllib.request\nmodule contains a function called\nurlopen()\nthat you can use to open a URL within a program.\nIn IDLE\u2019s interactive window, type the following to import\nurlopen()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nThe web page that you\u2019ll open is at the following URL:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\"\nTo open the web page, pass\nurl\nto\nurlopen()\n:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nurlopen()\nreturns an\nHTTPResponse\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n<http.client.HTTPResponse object at 0x105fef820>\nTo extract the HTML from the page, first use the\nHTTPResponse\nobject\u2019s\n.read()\nmethod, which returns a sequence of bytes. Then use\n.decode()\nto decode the bytes to a string using\nUTF-8\n:\nPython\n>>>\nhtml_bytes\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n>>>\nhtml\n=\nhtml_bytes\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nNow you can\nprint\nthe HTML to see the contents of the web page:\nPython\n>>>\nprint\n(\nhtml\n)\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Profile: Aphrodite</title>\n</head>\n<body bgcolor=\"yellow\">\n<center>\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"/static/aphrodite.gif\" />\n<h2>Name: Aphrodite</h2>\n<br><br>\nFavorite animal: Dove\n<br><br>\nFavorite color: Red\n<br><br>\nHometown: Mount Olympus\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\nThe output that you\u2019re seeing is the\nHTML code\nof the website, which your browser renders when you visit\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\n:\nWith\nurllib\n, you accessed the website similarly to how you would in your browser. However, instead of rendering the content visually, you grabbed the source code as text. Now that you have the HTML as text, you can extract information from it in a couple of different ways.\nExtract Text From HTML With String Methods\nOne way to extract information from a web page\u2019s HTML is to use\nstring methods\n. For instance, you can use\n.find()\nto search through the text of the HTML for the\n<title>\ntags and extract the title of the web page.\nTo start, you\u2019ll extract the title of the web page that you requested in the previous example. If you know the index of the first character of the title and the index of the first character of the closing\n</title>\ntag, then you can use a\nstring slice\nto extract the title.\nBecause\n.find()\nreturns the index of the first occurrence of a\nsubstring\n, you can get the index of the opening\n<title>\ntag by passing the string\n\"<title>\"\nto\n.find()\n:\nPython\n>>>\ntitle_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\ntitle_index\n14\nYou don\u2019t want the index of the\n<title>\ntag, though. You want the index of the title itself. To get the index of the first letter in the title, you can add the length of the string\n\"<title>\"\nto\ntitle_index\n:\nPython\n>>>\nstart_index\n=\ntitle_index\n+\nlen\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\nstart_index\n21\nNow get the index of the closing\n</title>\ntag by passing the string\n\"</title>\"\nto\n.find()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nend_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"</title>\"\n)\n>>>\nend_index\n39\nFinally, you can extract the title by slicing the\nhtml\nstring:\nPython\n>>>\ntitle\n=\nhtml\n[\nstart_index\n:\nend_index\n]\n>>>\ntitle\n'Profile: Aphrodite'\nReal-world HTML can be much more complicated and far less predictable than the HTML on the Aphrodite profile page. Here\u2019s\nanother profile page\nwith some messier HTML that you can scrape:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\"\nTry extracting the title from this new URL using the same method as in the previous example:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\"\n>>>\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\n>>>\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\n>>>\nstart_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n+\nlen\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\nend_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"</title>\"\n)\n>>>\ntitle\n=\nhtml\n[\nstart_index\n:\nend_index\n]\n>>>\ntitle\n'\\n<head>\\n<title >Profile: Poseidon'\nWhoops! There\u2019s a bit of HTML mixed in with the title. Why\u2019s that?\nThe HTML for the\n/profiles/poseidon\npage looks similar to the\n/profiles/aphrodite\npage, but there\u2019s a small difference. The opening\n<title>\ntag has an extra space before the closing angle bracket (\n>\n), rendering it as\n<title >\n.\nhtml.find(\"<title>\")\nreturns\n-1\nbecause the exact substring\n\"<title>\"\ndoesn\u2019t exist. When\n-1\nis added to\nlen(\"<title>\")\n, which is\n7\n, the\nstart_index\nvariable is assigned the value\n6\n.\nThe character at index\n6\nof the string\nhtml\nis a newline character (\n\\n\n) right before the opening angle bracket (\n<\n) of the\n<head>\ntag. This means that\nhtml[start_index:end_index]\nreturns all the HTML starting with that newline and ending just before the\n</title>\ntag.\nThese sorts of problems can occur in countless unpredictable ways. You need a more reliable way to extract text from HTML.\nRemove ads\nGet to Know Regular Expressions\nRegular expressions\n\u2014or\nregexes\nfor short\u2014are patterns that you can use to search for text within a string. Python supports regular expressions through the standard library\u2019s\nre\nmodule.\nNote:\nRegular expressions aren\u2019t particular to Python. They\u2019re a general programming concept and are supported in many programming languages.\nTo work with regular expressions, the first thing that you need to do is import the\nre\nmodule:\nPython\n>>>\nimport\nre\nRegular expressions use special characters called\nmetacharacters\nto denote different patterns. For instance, the asterisk character (\n*\n) stands for zero or more instances of whatever comes just before the asterisk.\nIn the following example, you use\n.findall()\nto find any text within a string that matches a given regular expression:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n['ac']\nThe first argument of\nre.findall()\nis the regular expression that you want to match, and the second argument is the string to test. In the above example, you search for the pattern\n\"ab*c\"\nin the string\n\"ac\"\n.\nThe regular expression\n\"ab*c\"\nmatches any part of the string that begins with\n\"a\"\n, ends with\n\"c\"\n, and has zero or more instances of\n\"b\"\nbetween the two.\nre.findall()\nreturns a\nlist\nof all matches. The string\n\"ac\"\nmatches this pattern, so it\u2019s returned in the list.\nHere\u2019s the same pattern applied to different strings:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abcd\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abcac\"\n)\n['abc', 'ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abdc\"\n)\n[]\nNotice that if no match is found, then\n.findall()\nreturns an empty list.\nPattern matching is case sensitive. If you want to match this pattern regardless of the case, then you can pass a third argument with the value\nre.IGNORECASE\n:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n['ABC']\nYou can use a period (\n.\n) to stand for any single character in a regular expression. For instance, you could find all the strings that contain the letters\n\"a\"\nand\n\"c\"\nseparated by a single character as follows:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"abc\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"abbc\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['acc']\nThe pattern\n.*\ninside a regular expression stands for any character repeated any number of times. For instance, you can use\n\"a.*c\"\nto find every substring that starts with\n\"a\"\nand ends with\n\"c\"\n, regardless of which letter\u2014or letters\u2014are in between:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"abc\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"abbc\"\n)\n['abbc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n['ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['acc']\nOften, you use\nre.search()\nto search for a particular pattern inside a string. This function is somewhat more complicated than\nre.findall()\nbecause it returns an object called\nMatchObject\nthat stores different groups of data. This is because there might be matches inside other matches, and\nre.search()\nreturns every possible result.\nThe details of\nMatchObject\nare irrelevant here. For now, just know that calling\n.group()\non\nMatchObject\nwill return the first and most inclusive result, which in most cases is just what you want:\nPython\n>>>\nmatch_results\n=\nre\n.\nsearch\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n>>>\nmatch_results\n.\ngroup\n()\n'ABC'\nThere\u2019s one more function in the\nre\nmodule that\u2019s useful for parsing out text.\nre.sub()\n, which is short for\nsubstitute\n, allows you to replace the text in a string that matches a regular expression with new text. It behaves sort of like the\n.replace()\nstring method.\nThe arguments passed to\nre.sub()\nare the regular expression, followed by the replacement text, followed by the string. Here\u2019s an example:\nPython\n>>>\nstring\n=\n\"Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>.\"\n>>>\nstring\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*>\"\n,\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\n,\nstring\n)\n>>>\nstring\n'Everything is ELEPHANTS.'\nPerhaps that wasn\u2019t quite what you expected to happen.\nre.sub()\nuses the regular expression\n\"<.*>\"\nto find and replace everything between the first\n<\nand the last\n>\n, which spans from the beginning of\n<replaced>\nto the end of\n<tags>\n. This is because Python\u2019s regular expressions are\ngreedy\n, meaning they try to find the longest possible match when characters like\n*\nare used.\nAlternatively, you can use the non-greedy matching pattern\n*?\n, which works the same way as\n*\nexcept that it matches the shortest possible string of text:\nPython\n>>>\nstring\n=\n\"Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>.\"\n>>>\nstring\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*?>\"\n,\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\n,\nstring\n)\n>>>\nstring\n\"Everything is ELEPHANTS if it's in ELEPHANTS.\"\nThis time,\nre.sub()\nfinds two matches,\n<replaced>\nand\n<tags>\n, and substitutes the string\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\nfor both matches.\nRemove ads\nExtract Text From HTML With Regular Expressions\nEquipped with all this knowledge, now try to parse out the title from\nanother profile page\n, which includes this rather carelessly written line of HTML:\nHTML\n<\nTITLE\n>\nProfile: Dionysus\n<\n/title / >\nThe\n.find()\nmethod would have a difficult time dealing with the inconsistencies here, but with the clever use of regular expressions, you can handle this code quickly and efficiently:\nPython\nregex_soup.py\nimport\nre\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\npattern\n=\n\"<title.*?>.*?</title.*?>\"\nmatch_results\n=\nre\n.\nsearch\n(\npattern\n,\nhtml\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\ntitle\n=\nmatch_results\n.\ngroup\n()\ntitle\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*?>\"\n,\n\"\"\n,\ntitle\n)\n# Remove HTML tags\nprint\n(\ntitle\n)\nTake a closer look at the first regular expression in the\npattern\nstring by breaking it down into three parts:\n<title.*?>\nmatches the opening\n<TITLE >\ntag in\nhtml\n. The\n<title\npart of the pattern matches with\n<TITLE\nbecause\nre.search()\nis called with\nre.IGNORECASE\n, and\n.*?>\nmatches any text after\n<TITLE\nup to the first instance of\n>\n.\n.*?\nnon-greedily matches all text after the opening\n<TITLE >\n, stopping at the first match for\n</title.*?>\n.\n</title.*?>\ndiffers from the first pattern only in its use of the\n/\ncharacter, so it matches the closing\n</title / >\ntag in\nhtml\n.\nThe second regular expression, the string\n\"<.*?>\"\n, also uses the non-greedy\n.*?\nto match all the HTML tags in the\ntitle\nstring. By replacing any matches with\n\"\"\n,\nre.sub()\nremoves all the tags and returns only the text.\nNote:\nWeb scraping in Python or any other language can be tedious. No two websites are organized the same way, and HTML is often messy. Moreover, websites change over time. Web scrapers that work today aren\u2019t guaranteed to work next year\u2014or next week, for that matter!\nRegular expressions are a powerful tool when used correctly. In this introduction, you\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. For more about regular expressions and how to use them, check out the two-part series\nRegular Expressions: Regexes in Python\n.\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Scrape Data From a Website\nShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from the following URL:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\nThen use\n.find()\nto display the text following\nName:\nand\nFavorite Color:\n(not including any leading spaces or trailing HTML tags that might appear on the same line).\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Scrape Data From a Website\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nurlopen\nfunction from the\nurlib.request\nmodule:\nPython\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nThen open the URL and use the\n.read()\nmethod of the\nHTTPResponse\nobject returned by\nurlopen()\nto read the page\u2019s HTML:\nPython\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\nhtml_page\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml_text\n=\nhtml_page\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nThe\n.read()\nmethod returns a byte string, so you use\n.decode()\nto decode the bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.\nNow that you have the HTML source of the web page as a string assigned to the\nhtml_text\nvariable, you can extract Dionysus\u2019s name and favorite color from his profile. The structure of the HTML for Dionysus\u2019s profile is the same as for Aphrodite\u2019s profile, which you saw earlier.\nYou can get the name by finding the string\n\"Name:\"\nin the text and extracting everything that comes after the first occurence of the string and before the next HTML tag. That is, you need to extract everything after the colon (\n:\n) and before the first angle bracket (\n<\n). You can use the same technique to extract the favorite color.\nThe following\nfor\nloop\nextracts this text for both the name and favorite color:\nPython\nfor\nstring\nin\n[\n\"Name: \"\n,\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n]:\nstring_start_idx\n=\nhtml_text\n.\nfind\n(\nstring\n)\ntext_start_idx\n=\nstring_start_idx\n+\nlen\n(\nstring\n)\nnext_html_tag_offset\n=\nhtml_text\n[\ntext_start_idx\n:]\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<\"\n)\ntext_end_idx\n=\ntext_start_idx\n+\nnext_html_tag_offset\nraw_text\n=\nhtml_text\n[\ntext_start_idx\n:\ntext_end_idx\n]\nclean_text\n=\nraw_text\n.\nstrip\n(\n\"\n\\r\\n\\t\n\"\n)\nprint\n(\nclean_text\n)\nIt looks like there\u2019s a lot going on in this\nfor\nloop, but it\u2019s just a little bit of arithmetic to calculate the right indices for extracting the desired text. Go ahead and break it down:\nYou use\nhtml_text.find()\nto find the starting index of the string, either\n\"Name:\"\nor\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n, and then assign the index to\nstring_start_idx\n.\nSince the text to extract starts just after the colon in\n\"Name:\"\nor\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n, you get the index of the character immediately after the colon by adding the length of the string to\nstart_string_idx\n, and then assign the result to\ntext_start_idx\n.\nYou calculate the ending index of the text to extract by determining the index of the first angle bracket (\n<\n) relative to\ntext_start_idx\nand assign this value to\nnext_html_tag_offset\n. Then you add that value to\ntext_start_idx\nand assign the result to\ntext_end_idx\n.\nYou extract the text by slicing\nhtml_text\nfrom\ntext_start_idx\nto\ntext_end_idx\nand assign this string to\nraw_text\n.\nYou remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of\nraw_text\nusing\n.strip()\nand assign the result to\nclean_text\n.\nAt the end of the loop, you use\nprint()\nto display the extracted text. The final output looks like this:\nShell\nDionysus\nWine\nThis solution is one of many that solves this problem, so if you got the same output with a different solution, then you did great!\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nUse an HTML Parser for Web Scraping in Python\nAlthough regular expressions are great for pattern matching in general, sometimes it\u2019s easier to use an HTML parser that\u2019s explicitly designed for parsing out HTML pages. There are many Python tools written for this purpose, but the\nBeautiful Soup\nlibrary is a good one to start with.\nInstall Beautiful Soup\nTo install Beautiful Soup, you can run the following in your\nterminal\n:\nShell\n$\npython\n-m\npip\ninstall\nbeautifulsoup4\nWith this command, you\u2019re installing the latest version of Beautiful Soup into your global Python environment.\nRemove ads\nCreate a\nBeautifulSoup\nObject\nType the following program into a new editor window:\nPython\nbeauty_soup.py\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup\n(\nhtml\n,\n\"html.parser\"\n)\nThis program does three things:\nOpens the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nby using\nurlopen()\nfrom the\nurllib.request\nmodule\nReads the HTML from the page as a string and assigns it to the\nhtml\nvariable\nCreates a\nBeautifulSoup\nobject and assigns it to the\nsoup\nvariable\nThe\nBeautifulSoup\nobject assigned to\nsoup\nis created with two arguments. The first argument is the HTML to be parsed, and the second argument, the string\n\"html.parser\"\n, tells the object which parser to use behind the scenes.\n\"html.parser\"\nrepresents Python\u2019s built-in HTML parser.\nUse a\nBeautifulSoup\nObject\nSave and run the above program. When it\u2019s finished running, you can use the\nsoup\nvariable in the interactive window to parse the content of\nhtml\nin various ways.\nNote:\nIf you\u2019re not using IDLE, then you can run your program with the\n-i\nflag to enter interactive mode. Something like\npython -i beauty_soup.py\nwill first run your program and then leave you in a REPL where you can explore your objects.\nFor example,\nBeautifulSoup\nobjects have a\n.get_text()\nmethod that you can use to extract all the text from the document and automatically remove any HTML tags.\nType the following code into IDLE\u2019s interactive window or at the end of the code in your editor:\nPython\n>>>\nprint\n(\nsoup\n.\nget_text\n())\nProfile: Dionysus\nName: Dionysus\nHometown: Mount Olympus\nFavorite animal: Leopard\nFavorite Color: Wine\nThere are a lot of blank lines in this output. These are the result of newline characters in the HTML document\u2019s text. You can remove them with the\n.replace()\nstring method if you need to.\nOften, you need to get only specific text from an HTML document. Using Beautiful Soup first to extract the text and then using the\n.find()\nstring method is sometimes easier than working with regular expressions.\nHowever, other times the HTML tags themselves are the elements that point out the data you want to retrieve. For instance, perhaps you want to retrieve the URLs for all the images on the page. These links are contained in the\nsrc\nattribute of\n<img>\nHTML tags.\nIn this case, you can use\nfind_all()\nto return a list of all instances of that particular tag:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n)\n[<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>, <img src=\"/static/grapes.png\"/>]\nThis returns a list of all\n<img>\ntags in the HTML document. The objects in the list look like they might be strings representing the tags, but they\u2019re actually instances of the\nTag\nobject provided by Beautiful Soup.\nTag\nobjects provide a simple interface for working with the information they contain.\nYou can explore this a little by first unpacking the\nTag\nobjects from the list:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n,\nimage2\n=\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n)\nEach\nTag\nobject has a\n.name\nproperty that returns a string containing the HTML tag type:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n.\nname\n'img'\nYou can access the HTML attributes of the\nTag\nobject by putting their names between square brackets, just as if the attributes were keys in a dictionary.\nFor example, the\n<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>\ntag has a single attribute,\nsrc\n, with the value\n\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"\n. Likewise, an HTML tag such as the link\n<a href=\"https://realpython.com\" target=\"_blank\">\nhas two attributes,\nhref\nand\ntarget\n.\nTo get the source of the images in the Dionysus profile page, you access the\nsrc\nattribute using the dictionary notation mentioned above:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n[\n\"src\"\n]\n'/static/dionysus.jpg'\n>>>\nimage2\n[\n\"src\"\n]\n'/static/grapes.png'\nCertain tags in HTML documents can be accessed by properties of the\nTag\nobject. For example, to get the\n<title>\ntag in a document, you can use the\n.title\nproperty:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n<title>Profile: Dionysus</title>\nIf you look at the source of the Dionysus profile by navigating to the\nprofile page\n, right-clicking on the page, and selecting\nView page source\n, then you\u2019ll notice that the\n<title>\ntag is written in all caps with spaces:\nBeautiful Soup automatically cleans up the tags for you by removing the extra space in the opening tag and the extraneous forward slash (\n/\n) in the closing tag.\nYou can also retrieve just the string between the title tags with the\n.string\nproperty of the\nTag\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n.\nstring\n'Profile: Dionysus'\nOne of the features of Beautiful Soup is the ability to search for specific kinds of tags whose attributes match certain values. For example, if you want to find all the\n<img>\ntags that have a\nsrc\nattribute equal to the value\n/static/dionysus.jpg\n, then you can provide the following additional argument to\n.find_all()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n,\nsrc\n=\n\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"\n)\n[<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>]\nThis example is somewhat arbitrary, and the usefulness of this technique may not be apparent from the example. If you spend some time browsing various websites and viewing their page sources, then you\u2019ll notice that many websites have extremely complicated HTML structures.\nWhen scraping data from websites with Python, you\u2019re often interested in particular parts of the page. By spending some time looking through the HTML document, you can identify tags with unique attributes that you can use to extract the data you need.\nThen, instead of relying on complicated regular expressions or using\n.find()\nto search through the document, you can directly access the particular tag that you\u2019re interested in and extract the data you need.\nIn some cases, you may find that Beautiful Soup doesn\u2019t offer the functionality you need. The\nlxml\nlibrary is somewhat trickier to get started with but offers far more flexibility than Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML documents. You may want to check it out once you\u2019re comfortable using Beautiful Soup.\nNote:\nHTML parsers like Beautiful Soup can save you a lot of time and effort when it comes to locating specific data in web pages. However, sometimes HTML is so poorly written and disorganized that even a sophisticated parser like Beautiful Soup can\u2019t interpret the HTML tags properly.\nIn this case, you\u2019re often left with using\n.find()\nand regular expression techniques to try to parse out the information that you need.\nBeautiful Soup is great for scraping data from a website\u2019s HTML, but it doesn\u2019t provide any way to work with HTML forms. For example, if you need to search a website for some query and then scrape the results, then Beautiful Soup alone won\u2019t get you very far.\nRemove ads\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Parse HTML With Beautiful Soup\nShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from the\npage\nat the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles\n.\nUsing Beautiful Soup, print out a list of all the links on the page by looking for HTML tags with the name\na\nand retrieving the value taken on by the\nhref\nattribute of each tag.\nThe final output should look like this:\nShell\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nMake sure that you only have one slash (\n/\n) between the base URL and the relative URL.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution:\nSolution: Parse HTML With Beautiful Soup\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nurlopen\nfunction from the\nurlib.request\nmodule and the\nBeautifulSoup\nclass from the\nbs4\npackage:\nPython\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nEach link URL on the\n/profiles\npage is a\nrelative URL\n, so create a\nbase_url\nvariable with the base URL of the website:\nPython\nbase_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org\"\nYou can build a full URL by concatenating\nbase_url\nwith a relative URL.\nNow open the\n/profiles\npage with\nurlopen()\nand use\n.read()\nto get the HTML source:\nPython\nhtml_page\n=\nurlopen\n(\nbase_url\n+\n\"/profiles\"\n)\nhtml_text\n=\nhtml_page\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nWith the HTML source downloaded and decoded, you can create a new\nBeautifulSoup\nobject to parse the HTML:\nPython\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup\n(\nhtml_text\n,\n\"html.parser\"\n)\nsoup.find_all(\"a\")\nreturns a list of all the links in the HTML source. You can loop over this list to print out all the links on the web page:\nPython\nfor\nlink\nin\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"a\"\n):\nlink_url\n=\nbase_url\n+\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\nprint\n(\nlink_url\n)\nYou can access the relative URL for each link through the\n\"href\"\nsubscript. Concatenate this value with\nbase_url\nto create the full\nlink_url\n.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nInteract With HTML Forms\nThe\nurllib\nmodule that you\u2019ve been working with so far in this tutorial is well suited for requesting the contents of a web page. Sometimes, though, you need to interact with a web page to obtain the content you need. For example, you might need to submit a form or click a button to display hidden content.\nNote:\nThis tutorial is adapted from the chapter \u201cInteracting With the Web\u201d in\nPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3\n. If you enjoy what you\u2019re reading, then be sure to check out\nthe rest of the book\n.\nThe Python standard library doesn\u2019t provide a built-in means for working with web pages interactively, but many third-party packages are available from\nPyPI\n. Among these,\nMechanicalSoup\nis a popular and relatively straightforward package to use.\nIn essence, MechanicalSoup installs what\u2019s known as a\nheadless browser\n, which is a web browser with no graphical user interface. This browser is controlled programmatically via a Python program.\nInstall MechanicalSoup\nYou can install MechanicalSoup with\npip\nin your terminal:\nShell\n$\npython\n-m\npip\ninstall\nMechanicalSoup\nYou\u2019ll need to close and restart your IDLE session for MechanicalSoup to load and be recognized after it\u2019s been installed.\nCreate a\nBrowser\nObject\nType the following into IDLE\u2019s interactive window:\nPython\n>>>\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\n>>>\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nBrowser\nobjects represent the headless web browser. You can use them to request a page from the Internet by passing a URL to their\n.get()\nmethod:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\n>>>\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nurl\n)\npage\nis a\nResponse\nobject that stores the response from requesting the URL from the browser:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n<Response [200]>\nThe number\n200\nrepresents the\nstatus code\nreturned by the request. A status code of\n200\nmeans that the request was successful. An unsuccessful request might show a status code of\n404\nif the URL doesn\u2019t exist or\n500\nif there\u2019s a server error when making the request.\nMechanicalSoup uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML from the request, and\npage\nhas a\n.soup\nattribute that represents a\nBeautifulSoup\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\ntype\n(\npage\n.\nsoup\n)\n<class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'>\nYou can view the HTML by inspecting the\n.soup\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n.\nsoup\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Log In</title>\n</head>\n<body bgcolor=\"yellow\">\n<center>\n<br/><br/>\n<h2>Please log in to access Mount Olympus:</h2>\n<br/><br/>\n<form action=\"/login\" method=\"post\" name=\"login\">\nUsername: <input name=\"user\" type=\"text\"/><br/>\nPassword: <input name=\"pwd\" type=\"password\"/><br/><br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"/>\n</form>\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\nNotice this page has a\n<form>\non it with\n<input>\nelements for a username and a password.\nRemove ads\nSubmit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nOpen the\n/login\npage from the previous example in a browser and look at it yourself before moving on:\nTry typing in a random username and password combination. If you guess incorrectly, then the message\nWrong username or password!\nis displayed at the bottom of the page.\nHowever, if you provide the correct login credentials, then you\u2019re redirected to the\n/profiles\npage:\nUsername\nPassword\nzeus\nThunderDude\nIn the next example, you\u2019ll see how to use MechanicalSoup to fill out and submit this form using Python!\nThe important section of HTML code is the login form\u2014that is, everything inside the\n<form>\ntags. The\n<form>\non this page has the\nname\nattribute set to\nlogin\n. This form contains two\n<input>\nelements, one named\nuser\nand the other named\npwd\n. The third\n<input>\nelement is the\nSubmit\nbutton.\nNow that you know the underlying structure of the login form, as well as the credentials needed to log in, take a look at a program that fills the form out and submits it.\nIn a new editor window, type in the following program:\nPython\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\n# 1\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\nlogin_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nurl\n)\nlogin_html\n=\nlogin_page\n.\nsoup\n# 2\nform\n=\nlogin_html\n.\nselect\n(\n\"form\"\n)[\n0\n]\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n0\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"zeus\"\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n1\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"ThunderDude\"\n# 3\nprofiles_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nsubmit\n(\nform\n,\nlogin_page\n.\nurl\n)\nSave the file and press\nF5\nto run it. To confirm that you\u2019ve successfully logged in, type the following into the interactive window:\nPython\n>>>\nprofiles_page\n.\nurl\n'http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles'\nNow break down the above example:\nYou create a\nBrowser\ninstance and use it to request the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login\n. You assign the HTML content of the page to the\nlogin_html\nvariable using the\n.soup\nproperty.\nlogin_html.select(\"form\")\nreturns a list of all\n<form>\nelements on the page. Because the page has only one\n<form>\nelement, you can access the form by retrieving the element at index\n0\nof the list. When there is only one form on a page, you may also use\nlogin_html.form\n. The next two lines select the username and password inputs and set their value to\n\"zeus\"\nand\n\"ThunderDude\"\n, respectively.\nYou submit the form with\nbrowser.submit()\n. Notice that you pass two arguments to this method, the\nform\nobject and the URL of the\nlogin_page\n, which you access via\nlogin_page.url\n.\nIn the interactive window, you confirm that the submission successfully redirected to the\n/profiles\npage. If something had gone wrong, then the value of\nprofiles_page.url\nwould still be\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\n.\nNote:\nHackers can use automated programs like the one above to\nbrute force\nlogins by rapidly trying many different usernames and passwords until they find a working combination.\nBesides this being highly illegal, almost all websites these days lock you out and report your IP address if they see you making too many failed requests, so don\u2019t try it!\nNow that you have the\nprofiles_page\nvariable set, it\u2019s time to programmatically obtain the URL for each link on the\n/profiles\npage.\nTo do this, you use\n.select()\nagain, this time passing the string\n\"a\"\nto select all the\n<a>\nanchor elements on the page:\nPython\n>>>\nlinks\n=\nprofiles_page\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"a\"\n)\nNow you can iterate over each link and print the\nhref\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks\n:\n...\naddress\n=\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\n...\ntext\n=\nlink\n.\ntext\n...\nprint\n(\nf\n\"\n{\ntext\n}\n:\n{\naddress\n}\n\"\n)\n...\nAphrodite: /profiles/aphrodite\nPoseidon: /profiles/poseidon\nDionysus: /profiles/dionysus\nThe URLs contained in each\nhref\nattribute are relative URLs, which aren\u2019t very helpful if you want to navigate to them later using MechanicalSoup. If you happen to know the full URL, then you can assign the portion needed to construct a full URL.\nIn this case, the base URL is just\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org\n. Then you can concatenate the base URL with the relative URLs found in the\nsrc\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\nbase_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org\"\n>>>\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks\n:\n...\naddress\n=\nbase_url\n+\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\n...\ntext\n=\nlink\n.\ntext\n...\nprint\n(\nf\n\"\n{\ntext\n}\n:\n{\naddress\n}\n\"\n)\n...\nAphrodite: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\nPoseidon: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\nDionysus: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nYou can do a lot with just\n.get()\n,\n.select()\n, and\n.submit()\n. That said, MechanicalSoup is capable of much more. To learn more about MechanicalSoup, check out the\nofficial docs\n.\nRemove ads\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding\nExercise: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nShow/Hide\nUse MechanicalSoup to provide the correct username (\nzeus\n) and password (\nThunderDude\n) to the\nlogin form\nlocated at the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login\n.\nOnce the form is submitted, display the title of the current page to determine that you\u2019ve been redirected to the\n/profiles\npage.\nYour program should print the text\n<title>All Profiles</title>\n.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nmechanicalsoup\npackage and create a\nBroswer\nobject:\nPython\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nPoint the browser to the login page by passing the URL to\nbrowser.get()\nand grab the HTML with the\n.soup\nattribute:\nPython\nlogin_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\nlogin_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nlogin_url\n)\nlogin_html\n=\nlogin_page\n.\nsoup\nlogin_html\nis a\nBeautifulSoup\ninstance. Because the page has only a single form on it, you can access the form via\nlogin_html.form\n. Using\n.select()\n, select the username and password inputs and fill them with the username\n\"zeus\"\nand the password\n\"ThunderDude\"\n:\nPython\nform\n=\nlogin_html\n.\nform\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n0\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"zeus\"\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n1\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"ThunderDude\"\nNow that the form is filled out, you can submit it with\nbrowser.submit()\n:\nPython\nprofiles_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nsubmit\n(\nform\n,\nlogin_page\n.\nurl\n)\nIf you filled the form with the correct username and password, then\nprofiles_page\nshould actually point to the\n/profiles\npage. You can confirm this by printing the title of the page assigned to\nprofiles_page:\nPython\nprint\n(\nprofiles_page\n.\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n)\nYou should see the following text displayed:\nShell\n<title>All Profiles</title>\nIf instead you see the text\nLog In\nor something else, then the form submission failed.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nInteract With Websites in Real Time\nSometimes you want to be able to fetch real-time data from a website that offers continually updated information.\nIn the dark days before you learned Python programming, you had to sit in front of a browser, clicking the\nRefresh\nbutton to reload the page each time you wanted to check if updated content was available. But now you can automate this process using the\n.get()\nmethod of the MechanicalSoup\nBrowser\nobject.\nOpen your browser of choice and navigate to the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/dice\n:\nThis\n/dice\npage simulates a roll of a six-sided die, updating the result each time you refresh the browser. Below, you\u2019ll write a program that repeatedly scrapes the page for a new result.\nThe first thing you need to do is determine which element on the page contains the result of the die roll. Do this now by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting\nView page source\n. A little more than halfway down the HTML code is an\n<h2>\ntag that looks like this:\nHTML\n<\nh2\nid\n=\n\"result\"\n>\n3\n</\nh2\n>\nThe text of the\n<h2>\ntag might be different for you, but this is the page element you need for scraping the result.\nNote:\nFor this example, you can easily check that there\u2019s only one element on the page with\nid=\"result\"\n. Although the\nid\nattribute is supposed to be unique, in practice you should always check that the element you\u2019re interested in is uniquely identified.\nNow start by writing a simple program that opens the\n/dice\npage, scrapes the result, and prints it to the console:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\nThis example uses the\nBeautifulSoup\nobject\u2019s\n.select()\nmethod to find the element with\nid=result\n. The string\n\"#result\"\n, which you pass to\n.select()\n, uses the\nCSS ID selector\n#\nto indicate that\nresult\nis an\nid\nvalue.\nTo periodically get a new result, you\u2019ll need to create a loop that loads the page at each step. So everything below the line\nbrowser = mechanicalsoup.Browser()\nin the above code needs to go in the body of the loop.\nFor this example, you want four rolls of the dice at ten-second intervals. To do that, the last line of your code needs to tell Python to pause running for ten seconds. You can do this with\n.sleep()\nfrom Python\u2019s\ntime\nmodule\n. The\n.sleep()\nmethod takes a single argument that represents the amount of time to sleep in seconds.\nHere\u2019s an example that illustrates how\nsleep()\nworks:\nPython\nimport\ntime\nprint\n(\n\"I'm about to wait for five seconds...\"\n)\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n5\n)\nprint\n(\n\"Done waiting!\"\n)\nWhen you run this code, you\u2019ll see that the\n\"Done waiting!\"\nmessage isn\u2019t displayed until five seconds have passed from when the first\nprint()\nfunction was executed.\nFor the die roll example, you\u2019ll need to pass the number\n10\nto\nsleep()\n. Here\u2019s the updated program:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\ntime\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nfor\ni\nin\nrange\n(\n4\n):\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n10\n)\nWhen you run the program, you\u2019ll immediately see the first result printed to the console. After ten seconds, the second result is displayed, then the third, and finally the fourth. What happens after the fourth result is printed?\nThe program continues running for another ten seconds before it finally stops. That\u2019s kind of a waste of time! You can stop it from doing this by using an\nif\nstatement\nto run\ntime.sleep()\nfor only the first three requests:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\ntime\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nfor\ni\nin\nrange\n(\n4\n):\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\n# Wait 10 seconds if this isn't the last request\nif\ni\n<\n3\n:\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n10\n)\nWith techniques like this, you can scrape data from websites that periodically update their data. However, you should be aware that requesting a page multiple times in rapid succession can be seen as suspicious, or even malicious, use of a website.\nImportant:\nMost websites publish a Terms of Use document. You can often find a link to it in the website\u2019s footer.\nAlways read this document before attempting to scrape data from a website. If you can\u2019t find the Terms of Use, then try to contact the website owner and ask them if they have any policies regarding request volume.\nFailure to comply with the Terms of Use could result in your IP being blocked, so be careful!\nIt\u2019s even possible to crash a server with an excessive number of requests, so you can imagine that many websites are concerned about the volume of requests to their server! Always check the Terms of Use and be respectful when sending multiple requests to a website.\nRemove ads\nConclusion\nAlthough it\u2019s possible to parse data from the Web using tools in Python\u2019s standard library, there are many tools on PyPI that can help simplify the process.\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to:\nRequest a web page using Python\u2019s built-in\nurllib\nmodule\nParse HTML using\nBeautiful Soup\nInteract with web forms using\nMechanicalSoup\nRepeatedly request data from a website to\ncheck for updates\nWriting automated web scraping programs is fun, and the Internet has no shortage of content that can lead to all sorts of exciting projects.\nJust remember, not everyone wants you pulling data from their web servers.

The robots were not programmed to perform these new actions, instead adapting to their environment powered by new artificial intelligence models. \u201cThese are the moments where you think this is the next revolution,\u201d said Fankhauser, chief executive of ANYbotics, a Zurich-based robotics start-up. \u201cThese things started to move really artistically, and it\u2019s almost scary because the robots play with physics.\u201d Over the past decade, the $74bn robotics sector has accelerated in capabilities due to significant leaps in AI, such as advances in neural networks, systems that mimic the human brain. The world\u2019s biggest tech and AI companies, from Google, OpenAI and Tesla, are among those racing to build the AI \u201cbrain\u201d that can autonomously operate robotics in moves that could transform industries from manufacturing to healthcare. In particular, improved computer vision and spatial reasoning capabilities have allowed robots to gain greater autonomy while navigating varied environments, from construction sites to oil rigs and city roads. Training and programming robots previously required engineers to hardwire rules and instructions that taught the machine how to behave, often specific to each system or environment. The advent of deep learning models in recent years has enabled experts to train AI software that allows machines to be far more adaptive and reactive to unexpected physical challenges in the real world and learn by themselves.\nFull story :\nGoogle, OpenAI and Tesla race start-ups to develop AI robotic systems in effort to transform healthcare and manufacturing.\nTagged:\nAI\nautomation\nHealth Care\nRobotics\nRelated Posts\nInforming your decisions with actionable intelligence\nBecome a Member\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 \u2014 All Rights Reserved.\nInforming your decisions with actionable intelligence\nSubscribe\nSign In",

With powerful libraries like\nurllib\n, Beautiful Soup, and MechanicalSoup, you can fetch and manipulate HTML content effortlessly. By automating data collection tasks, Python makes web scraping both efficient and effective.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you\u2019ll understand that:\nPython is\nwell-suited for web scraping\ndue to its\nextensive libraries\n, such as Beautiful Soup and MechanicalSoup.\nYou can scrape websites with Python by\nfetching HTML content\nusing\nurllib\nand\nextracting data\nusing string methods or parsers like Beautiful Soup.\nBeautiful Soup\nis a great choice for\nparsing HTML\ndocuments with Python effectively.\nData scraping may be illegal\nif it violates a website\u2019s terms of use, so always review the website\u2019s acceptable use policy.\nThis tutorial guides you through extracting data from websites using string methods, regular expressions, and HTML parsers.\nNote:\nThis tutorial is adapted from the chapter \u201cInteracting With the Web\u201d in\nPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3\n.\nThe book uses Python\u2019s built-in\nIDLE\neditor to create and edit Python files and interact with the Python shell, so you\u2019ll see occasional references to IDLE throughout this tutorial. However, you should have no problems running the example code from the\neditor\nand\nenvironment\nof your choice.\nSource Code:\nClick here to download the free source code\nthat you\u2019ll use to collect and parse data from the Web.\nTake the Quiz:\nTest your knowledge with our interactive \u201cA Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python\u201d quiz. You\u2019ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\nInteractive Quiz\nA Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of web scraping in Python. Web scraping is a powerful tool for data collection and analysis. By working through this quiz, you'll revisit how to parse website data using string methods, regular expressions, and HTML parsers, as well as how to interact with forms and other website components.\nScrape and Parse Text From Websites\nCollecting data from websites using an automated process is known as web scraping. Some websites explicitly forbid users from scraping their data with automated tools like the ones that you\u2019ll create in this tutorial. Websites do this for two possible reasons:\nThe site has a good reason to protect its data. For instance, Google Maps doesn\u2019t let you request too many results too quickly.\nMaking many repeated requests to a website\u2019s server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website for other users and potentially overloading the server such that the website stops responding entirely.\nBefore using your Python skills for web scraping, you should always check your target website\u2019s acceptable use policy to see if accessing the website with automated tools is a violation of its terms of use. Legally, web scraping against the wishes of a website is very much a gray area.\nImportant:\nPlease be aware that the following techniques\nmay be illegal\nwhen used on websites that prohibit web scraping.\nFor this tutorial, you\u2019ll use a page that\u2019s hosted on Real Python\u2019s server. The page that you\u2019ll access has been set up for use with this tutorial.\nNow that you\u2019ve read the disclaimer, you can get to the fun stuff. In the next section, you\u2019ll start grabbing all the HTML code from a single web page.\nRemove ads\nBuild Your First Web Scraper\nOne useful package for web scraping that you can find in Python\u2019s\nstandard library\nis\nurllib\n, which contains tools for working with URLs. In particular, the\nurllib.request\nmodule contains a function called\nurlopen()\nthat you can use to open a URL within a program.\nIn IDLE\u2019s interactive window, type the following to import\nurlopen()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nThe web page that you\u2019ll open is at the following URL:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\"\nTo open the web page, pass\nurl\nto\nurlopen()\n:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nurlopen()\nreturns an\nHTTPResponse\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n<http.client.HTTPResponse object at 0x105fef820>\nTo extract the HTML from the page, first use the\nHTTPResponse\nobject\u2019s\n.read()\nmethod, which returns a sequence of bytes. Then use\n.decode()\nto decode the bytes to a string using\nUTF-8\n:\nPython\n>>>\nhtml_bytes\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n>>>\nhtml\n=\nhtml_bytes\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nNow you can\nprint\nthe HTML to see the contents of the web page:\nPython\n>>>\nprint\n(\nhtml\n)\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Profile: Aphrodite</title>\n</head>\n<body bgcolor=\"yellow\">\n<center>\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"/static/aphrodite.gif\" />\n<h2>Name: Aphrodite</h2>\n<br><br>\nFavorite animal: Dove\n<br><br>\nFavorite color: Red\n<br><br>\nHometown: Mount Olympus\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\nThe output that you\u2019re seeing is the\nHTML code\nof the website, which your browser renders when you visit\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\n:\nWith\nurllib\n, you accessed the website similarly to how you would in your browser. However, instead of rendering the content visually, you grabbed the source code as text. Now that you have the HTML as text, you can extract information from it in a couple of different ways.\nExtract Text From HTML With String Methods\nOne way to extract information from a web page\u2019s HTML is to use\nstring methods\n. For instance, you can use\n.find()\nto search through the text of the HTML for the\n<title>\ntags and extract the title of the web page.\nTo start, you\u2019ll extract the title of the web page that you requested in the previous example. If you know the index of the first character of the title and the index of the first character of the closing\n</title>\ntag, then you can use a\nstring slice\nto extract the title.\nBecause\n.find()\nreturns the index of the first occurrence of a\nsubstring\n, you can get the index of the opening\n<title>\ntag by passing the string\n\"<title>\"\nto\n.find()\n:\nPython\n>>>\ntitle_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\ntitle_index\n14\nYou don\u2019t want the index of the\n<title>\ntag, though. You want the index of the title itself. To get the index of the first letter in the title, you can add the length of the string\n\"<title>\"\nto\ntitle_index\n:\nPython\n>>>\nstart_index\n=\ntitle_index\n+\nlen\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\nstart_index\n21\nNow get the index of the closing\n</title>\ntag by passing the string\n\"</title>\"\nto\n.find()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nend_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"</title>\"\n)\n>>>\nend_index\n39\nFinally, you can extract the title by slicing the\nhtml\nstring:\nPython\n>>>\ntitle\n=\nhtml\n[\nstart_index\n:\nend_index\n]\n>>>\ntitle\n'Profile: Aphrodite'\nReal-world HTML can be much more complicated and far less predictable than the HTML on the Aphrodite profile page. Here\u2019s\nanother profile page\nwith some messier HTML that you can scrape:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\"\nTry extracting the title from this new URL using the same method as in the previous example:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\"\n>>>\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\n>>>\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\n>>>\nstart_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n+\nlen\n(\n\"<title>\"\n)\n>>>\nend_index\n=\nhtml\n.\nfind\n(\n\"</title>\"\n)\n>>>\ntitle\n=\nhtml\n[\nstart_index\n:\nend_index\n]\n>>>\ntitle\n'\\n<head>\\n<title >Profile: Poseidon'\nWhoops! There\u2019s a bit of HTML mixed in with the title. Why\u2019s that?\nThe HTML for the\n/profiles/poseidon\npage looks similar to the\n/profiles/aphrodite\npage, but there\u2019s a small difference. The opening\n<title>\ntag has an extra space before the closing angle bracket (\n>\n), rendering it as\n<title >\n.\nhtml.find(\"<title>\")\nreturns\n-1\nbecause the exact substring\n\"<title>\"\ndoesn\u2019t exist. When\n-1\nis added to\nlen(\"<title>\")\n, which is\n7\n, the\nstart_index\nvariable is assigned the value\n6\n.\nThe character at index\n6\nof the string\nhtml\nis a newline character (\n\\n\n) right before the opening angle bracket (\n<\n) of the\n<head>\ntag. This means that\nhtml[start_index:end_index]\nreturns all the HTML starting with that newline and ending just before the\n</title>\ntag.\nThese sorts of problems can occur in countless unpredictable ways. You need a more reliable way to extract text from HTML.\nRemove ads\nGet to Know Regular Expressions\nRegular expressions\n\u2014or\nregexes\nfor short\u2014are patterns that you can use to search for text within a string. Python supports regular expressions through the standard library\u2019s\nre\nmodule.\nNote:\nRegular expressions aren\u2019t particular to Python. They\u2019re a general programming concept and are supported in many programming languages.\nTo work with regular expressions, the first thing that you need to do is import the\nre\nmodule:\nPython\n>>>\nimport\nre\nRegular expressions use special characters called\nmetacharacters\nto denote different patterns. For instance, the asterisk character (\n*\n) stands for zero or more instances of whatever comes just before the asterisk.\nIn the following example, you use\n.findall()\nto find any text within a string that matches a given regular expression:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n['ac']\nThe first argument of\nre.findall()\nis the regular expression that you want to match, and the second argument is the string to test. In the above example, you search for the pattern\n\"ab*c\"\nin the string\n\"ac\"\n.\nThe regular expression\n\"ab*c\"\nmatches any part of the string that begins with\n\"a\"\n, ends with\n\"c\"\n, and has zero or more instances of\n\"b\"\nbetween the two.\nre.findall()\nreturns a\nlist\nof all matches. The string\n\"ac\"\nmatches this pattern, so it\u2019s returned in the list.\nHere\u2019s the same pattern applied to different strings:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abcd\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abcac\"\n)\n['abc', 'ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"abdc\"\n)\n[]\nNotice that if no match is found, then\n.findall()\nreturns an empty list.\nPattern matching is case sensitive. If you want to match this pattern regardless of the case, then you can pass a third argument with the value\nre.IGNORECASE\n:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n['ABC']\nYou can use a period (\n.\n) to stand for any single character in a regular expression. For instance, you could find all the strings that contain the letters\n\"a\"\nand\n\"c\"\nseparated by a single character as follows:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"abc\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"abbc\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n[]\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['acc']\nThe pattern\n.*\ninside a regular expression stands for any character repeated any number of times. For instance, you can use\n\"a.*c\"\nto find every substring that starts with\n\"a\"\nand ends with\n\"c\"\n, regardless of which letter\u2014or letters\u2014are in between:\nPython\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"abc\"\n)\n['abc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"abbc\"\n)\n['abbc']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"ac\"\n)\n['ac']\n>>>\nre\n.\nfindall\n(\n\"a.*c\"\n,\n\"acc\"\n)\n['acc']\nOften, you use\nre.search()\nto search for a particular pattern inside a string. This function is somewhat more complicated than\nre.findall()\nbecause it returns an object called\nMatchObject\nthat stores different groups of data. This is because there might be matches inside other matches, and\nre.search()\nreturns every possible result.\nThe details of\nMatchObject\nare irrelevant here. For now, just know that calling\n.group()\non\nMatchObject\nwill return the first and most inclusive result, which in most cases is just what you want:\nPython\n>>>\nmatch_results\n=\nre\n.\nsearch\n(\n\"ab*c\"\n,\n\"ABC\"\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\n>>>\nmatch_results\n.\ngroup\n()\n'ABC'\nThere\u2019s one more function in the\nre\nmodule that\u2019s useful for parsing out text.\nre.sub()\n, which is short for\nsubstitute\n, allows you to replace the text in a string that matches a regular expression with new text. It behaves sort of like the\n.replace()\nstring method.\nThe arguments passed to\nre.sub()\nare the regular expression, followed by the replacement text, followed by the string. Here\u2019s an example:\nPython\n>>>\nstring\n=\n\"Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>.\"\n>>>\nstring\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*>\"\n,\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\n,\nstring\n)\n>>>\nstring\n'Everything is ELEPHANTS.'\nPerhaps that wasn\u2019t quite what you expected to happen.\nre.sub()\nuses the regular expression\n\"<.*>\"\nto find and replace everything between the first\n<\nand the last\n>\n, which spans from the beginning of\n<replaced>\nto the end of\n<tags>\n. This is because Python\u2019s regular expressions are\ngreedy\n, meaning they try to find the longest possible match when characters like\n*\nare used.\nAlternatively, you can use the non-greedy matching pattern\n*?\n, which works the same way as\n*\nexcept that it matches the shortest possible string of text:\nPython\n>>>\nstring\n=\n\"Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>.\"\n>>>\nstring\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*?>\"\n,\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\n,\nstring\n)\n>>>\nstring\n\"Everything is ELEPHANTS if it's in ELEPHANTS.\"\nThis time,\nre.sub()\nfinds two matches,\n<replaced>\nand\n<tags>\n, and substitutes the string\n\"ELEPHANTS\"\nfor both matches.\nRemove ads\nExtract Text From HTML With Regular Expressions\nEquipped with all this knowledge, now try to parse out the title from\nanother profile page\n, which includes this rather carelessly written line of HTML:\nHTML\n<\nTITLE\n>\nProfile: Dionysus\n<\n/title / >\nThe\n.find()\nmethod would have a difficult time dealing with the inconsistencies here, but with the clever use of regular expressions, you can handle this code quickly and efficiently:\nPython\nregex_soup.py\nimport\nre\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\npattern\n=\n\"<title.*?>.*?</title.*?>\"\nmatch_results\n=\nre\n.\nsearch\n(\npattern\n,\nhtml\n,\nre\n.\nIGNORECASE\n)\ntitle\n=\nmatch_results\n.\ngroup\n()\ntitle\n=\nre\n.\nsub\n(\n\"<.*?>\"\n,\n\"\"\n,\ntitle\n)\n# Remove HTML tags\nprint\n(\ntitle\n)\nTake a closer look at the first regular expression in the\npattern\nstring by breaking it down into three parts:\n<title.*?>\nmatches the opening\n<TITLE >\ntag in\nhtml\n. The\n<title\npart of the pattern matches with\n<TITLE\nbecause\nre.search()\nis called with\nre.IGNORECASE\n, and\n.*?>\nmatches any text after\n<TITLE\nup to the first instance of\n>\n.\n.*?\nnon-greedily matches all text after the opening\n<TITLE >\n, stopping at the first match for\n</title.*?>\n.\n</title.*?>\ndiffers from the first pattern only in its use of the\n/\ncharacter, so it matches the closing\n</title / >\ntag in\nhtml\n.\nThe second regular expression, the string\n\"<.*?>\"\n, also uses the non-greedy\n.*?\nto match all the HTML tags in the\ntitle\nstring. By replacing any matches with\n\"\"\n,\nre.sub()\nremoves all the tags and returns only the text.\nNote:\nWeb scraping in Python or any other language can be tedious. No two websites are organized the same way, and HTML is often messy. Moreover, websites change over time. Web scrapers that work today aren\u2019t guaranteed to work next year\u2014or next week, for that matter!\nRegular expressions are a powerful tool when used correctly. In this introduction, you\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. For more about regular expressions and how to use them, check out the two-part series\nRegular Expressions: Regexes in Python\n.\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Scrape Data From a Website\nShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from the following URL:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\nThen use\n.find()\nto display the text following\nName:\nand\nFavorite Color:\n(not including any leading spaces or trailing HTML tags that might appear on the same line).\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Scrape Data From a Website\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nurlopen\nfunction from the\nurlib.request\nmodule:\nPython\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nThen open the URL and use the\n.read()\nmethod of the\nHTTPResponse\nobject returned by\nurlopen()\nto read the page\u2019s HTML:\nPython\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\nhtml_page\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml_text\n=\nhtml_page\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nThe\n.read()\nmethod returns a byte string, so you use\n.decode()\nto decode the bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.\nNow that you have the HTML source of the web page as a string assigned to the\nhtml_text\nvariable, you can extract Dionysus\u2019s name and favorite color from his profile. The structure of the HTML for Dionysus\u2019s profile is the same as for Aphrodite\u2019s profile, which you saw earlier.\nYou can get the name by finding the string\n\"Name:\"\nin the text and extracting everything that comes after the first occurence of the string and before the next HTML tag. That is, you need to extract everything after the colon (\n:\n) and before the first angle bracket (\n<\n). You can use the same technique to extract the favorite color.\nThe following\nfor\nloop\nextracts this text for both the name and favorite color:\nPython\nfor\nstring\nin\n[\n\"Name: \"\n,\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n]:\nstring_start_idx\n=\nhtml_text\n.\nfind\n(\nstring\n)\ntext_start_idx\n=\nstring_start_idx\n+\nlen\n(\nstring\n)\nnext_html_tag_offset\n=\nhtml_text\n[\ntext_start_idx\n:]\n.\nfind\n(\n\"<\"\n)\ntext_end_idx\n=\ntext_start_idx\n+\nnext_html_tag_offset\nraw_text\n=\nhtml_text\n[\ntext_start_idx\n:\ntext_end_idx\n]\nclean_text\n=\nraw_text\n.\nstrip\n(\n\"\n\\r\\n\\t\n\"\n)\nprint\n(\nclean_text\n)\nIt looks like there\u2019s a lot going on in this\nfor\nloop, but it\u2019s just a little bit of arithmetic to calculate the right indices for extracting the desired text. Go ahead and break it down:\nYou use\nhtml_text.find()\nto find the starting index of the string, either\n\"Name:\"\nor\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n, and then assign the index to\nstring_start_idx\n.\nSince the text to extract starts just after the colon in\n\"Name:\"\nor\n\"Favorite Color:\"\n, you get the index of the character immediately after the colon by adding the length of the string to\nstart_string_idx\n, and then assign the result to\ntext_start_idx\n.\nYou calculate the ending index of the text to extract by determining the index of the first angle bracket (\n<\n) relative to\ntext_start_idx\nand assign this value to\nnext_html_tag_offset\n. Then you add that value to\ntext_start_idx\nand assign the result to\ntext_end_idx\n.\nYou extract the text by slicing\nhtml_text\nfrom\ntext_start_idx\nto\ntext_end_idx\nand assign this string to\nraw_text\n.\nYou remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of\nraw_text\nusing\n.strip()\nand assign the result to\nclean_text\n.\nAt the end of the loop, you use\nprint()\nto display the extracted text. The final output looks like this:\nShell\nDionysus\nWine\nThis solution is one of many that solves this problem, so if you got the same output with a different solution, then you did great!\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nUse an HTML Parser for Web Scraping in Python\nAlthough regular expressions are great for pattern matching in general, sometimes it\u2019s easier to use an HTML parser that\u2019s explicitly designed for parsing out HTML pages. There are many Python tools written for this purpose, but the\nBeautiful Soup\nlibrary is a good one to start with.\nInstall Beautiful Soup\nTo install Beautiful Soup, you can run the following in your\nterminal\n:\nShell\n$\npython\n-m\npip\ninstall\nbeautifulsoup4\nWith this command, you\u2019re installing the latest version of Beautiful Soup into your global Python environment.\nRemove ads\nCreate a\nBeautifulSoup\nObject\nType the following program into a new editor window:\nPython\nbeauty_soup.py\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\"\npage\n=\nurlopen\n(\nurl\n)\nhtml\n=\npage\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup\n(\nhtml\n,\n\"html.parser\"\n)\nThis program does three things:\nOpens the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nby using\nurlopen()\nfrom the\nurllib.request\nmodule\nReads the HTML from the page as a string and assigns it to the\nhtml\nvariable\nCreates a\nBeautifulSoup\nobject and assigns it to the\nsoup\nvariable\nThe\nBeautifulSoup\nobject assigned to\nsoup\nis created with two arguments. The first argument is the HTML to be parsed, and the second argument, the string\n\"html.parser\"\n, tells the object which parser to use behind the scenes.\n\"html.parser\"\nrepresents Python\u2019s built-in HTML parser.\nUse a\nBeautifulSoup\nObject\nSave and run the above program. When it\u2019s finished running, you can use the\nsoup\nvariable in the interactive window to parse the content of\nhtml\nin various ways.\nNote:\nIf you\u2019re not using IDLE, then you can run your program with the\n-i\nflag to enter interactive mode. Something like\npython -i beauty_soup.py\nwill first run your program and then leave you in a REPL where you can explore your objects.\nFor example,\nBeautifulSoup\nobjects have a\n.get_text()\nmethod that you can use to extract all the text from the document and automatically remove any HTML tags.\nType the following code into IDLE\u2019s interactive window or at the end of the code in your editor:\nPython\n>>>\nprint\n(\nsoup\n.\nget_text\n())\nProfile: Dionysus\nName: Dionysus\nHometown: Mount Olympus\nFavorite animal: Leopard\nFavorite Color: Wine\nThere are a lot of blank lines in this output. These are the result of newline characters in the HTML document\u2019s text. You can remove them with the\n.replace()\nstring method if you need to.\nOften, you need to get only specific text from an HTML document. Using Beautiful Soup first to extract the text and then using the\n.find()\nstring method is sometimes easier than working with regular expressions.\nHowever, other times the HTML tags themselves are the elements that point out the data you want to retrieve. For instance, perhaps you want to retrieve the URLs for all the images on the page. These links are contained in the\nsrc\nattribute of\n<img>\nHTML tags.\nIn this case, you can use\nfind_all()\nto return a list of all instances of that particular tag:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n)\n[<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>, <img src=\"/static/grapes.png\"/>]\nThis returns a list of all\n<img>\ntags in the HTML document. The objects in the list look like they might be strings representing the tags, but they\u2019re actually instances of the\nTag\nobject provided by Beautiful Soup.\nTag\nobjects provide a simple interface for working with the information they contain.\nYou can explore this a little by first unpacking the\nTag\nobjects from the list:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n,\nimage2\n=\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n)\nEach\nTag\nobject has a\n.name\nproperty that returns a string containing the HTML tag type:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n.\nname\n'img'\nYou can access the HTML attributes of the\nTag\nobject by putting their names between square brackets, just as if the attributes were keys in a dictionary.\nFor example, the\n<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>\ntag has a single attribute,\nsrc\n, with the value\n\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"\n. Likewise, an HTML tag such as the link\n<a href=\"https://realpython.com\" target=\"_blank\">\nhas two attributes,\nhref\nand\ntarget\n.\nTo get the source of the images in the Dionysus profile page, you access the\nsrc\nattribute using the dictionary notation mentioned above:\nPython\n>>>\nimage1\n[\n\"src\"\n]\n'/static/dionysus.jpg'\n>>>\nimage2\n[\n\"src\"\n]\n'/static/grapes.png'\nCertain tags in HTML documents can be accessed by properties of the\nTag\nobject. For example, to get the\n<title>\ntag in a document, you can use the\n.title\nproperty:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n<title>Profile: Dionysus</title>\nIf you look at the source of the Dionysus profile by navigating to the\nprofile page\n, right-clicking on the page, and selecting\nView page source\n, then you\u2019ll notice that the\n<title>\ntag is written in all caps with spaces:\nBeautiful Soup automatically cleans up the tags for you by removing the extra space in the opening tag and the extraneous forward slash (\n/\n) in the closing tag.\nYou can also retrieve just the string between the title tags with the\n.string\nproperty of the\nTag\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n.\nstring\n'Profile: Dionysus'\nOne of the features of Beautiful Soup is the ability to search for specific kinds of tags whose attributes match certain values. For example, if you want to find all the\n<img>\ntags that have a\nsrc\nattribute equal to the value\n/static/dionysus.jpg\n, then you can provide the following additional argument to\n.find_all()\n:\nPython\n>>>\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"img\"\n,\nsrc\n=\n\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"\n)\n[<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>]\nThis example is somewhat arbitrary, and the usefulness of this technique may not be apparent from the example. If you spend some time browsing various websites and viewing their page sources, then you\u2019ll notice that many websites have extremely complicated HTML structures.\nWhen scraping data from websites with Python, you\u2019re often interested in particular parts of the page. By spending some time looking through the HTML document, you can identify tags with unique attributes that you can use to extract the data you need.\nThen, instead of relying on complicated regular expressions or using\n.find()\nto search through the document, you can directly access the particular tag that you\u2019re interested in and extract the data you need.\nIn some cases, you may find that Beautiful Soup doesn\u2019t offer the functionality you need. The\nlxml\nlibrary is somewhat trickier to get started with but offers far more flexibility than Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML documents. You may want to check it out once you\u2019re comfortable using Beautiful Soup.\nNote:\nHTML parsers like Beautiful Soup can save you a lot of time and effort when it comes to locating specific data in web pages. However, sometimes HTML is so poorly written and disorganized that even a sophisticated parser like Beautiful Soup can\u2019t interpret the HTML tags properly.\nIn this case, you\u2019re often left with using\n.find()\nand regular expression techniques to try to parse out the information that you need.\nBeautiful Soup is great for scraping data from a website\u2019s HTML, but it doesn\u2019t provide any way to work with HTML forms. For example, if you need to search a website for some query and then scrape the results, then Beautiful Soup alone won\u2019t get you very far.\nRemove ads\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Parse HTML With Beautiful Soup\nShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from the\npage\nat the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles\n.\nUsing Beautiful Soup, print out a list of all the links on the page by looking for HTML tags with the name\na\nand retrieving the value taken on by the\nhref\nattribute of each tag.\nThe final output should look like this:\nShell\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nMake sure that you only have one slash (\n/\n) between the base URL and the relative URL.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution:\nSolution: Parse HTML With Beautiful Soup\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nurlopen\nfunction from the\nurlib.request\nmodule and the\nBeautifulSoup\nclass from the\nbs4\npackage:\nPython\nfrom\nurllib.request\nimport\nurlopen\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nEach link URL on the\n/profiles\npage is a\nrelative URL\n, so create a\nbase_url\nvariable with the base URL of the website:\nPython\nbase_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org\"\nYou can build a full URL by concatenating\nbase_url\nwith a relative URL.\nNow open the\n/profiles\npage with\nurlopen()\nand use\n.read()\nto get the HTML source:\nPython\nhtml_page\n=\nurlopen\n(\nbase_url\n+\n\"/profiles\"\n)\nhtml_text\n=\nhtml_page\n.\nread\n()\n.\ndecode\n(\n\"utf-8\"\n)\nWith the HTML source downloaded and decoded, you can create a new\nBeautifulSoup\nobject to parse the HTML:\nPython\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup\n(\nhtml_text\n,\n\"html.parser\"\n)\nsoup.find_all(\"a\")\nreturns a list of all the links in the HTML source. You can loop over this list to print out all the links on the web page:\nPython\nfor\nlink\nin\nsoup\n.\nfind_all\n(\n\"a\"\n):\nlink_url\n=\nbase_url\n+\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\nprint\n(\nlink_url\n)\nYou can access the relative URL for each link through the\n\"href\"\nsubscript. Concatenate this value with\nbase_url\nto create the full\nlink_url\n.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nInteract With HTML Forms\nThe\nurllib\nmodule that you\u2019ve been working with so far in this tutorial is well suited for requesting the contents of a web page. Sometimes, though, you need to interact with a web page to obtain the content you need. For example, you might need to submit a form or click a button to display hidden content.\nNote:\nThis tutorial is adapted from the chapter \u201cInteracting With the Web\u201d in\nPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3\n. If you enjoy what you\u2019re reading, then be sure to check out\nthe rest of the book\n.\nThe Python standard library doesn\u2019t provide a built-in means for working with web pages interactively, but many third-party packages are available from\nPyPI\n. Among these,\nMechanicalSoup\nis a popular and relatively straightforward package to use.\nIn essence, MechanicalSoup installs what\u2019s known as a\nheadless browser\n, which is a web browser with no graphical user interface. This browser is controlled programmatically via a Python program.\nInstall MechanicalSoup\nYou can install MechanicalSoup with\npip\nin your terminal:\nShell\n$\npython\n-m\npip\ninstall\nMechanicalSoup\nYou\u2019ll need to close and restart your IDLE session for MechanicalSoup to load and be recognized after it\u2019s been installed.\nCreate a\nBrowser\nObject\nType the following into IDLE\u2019s interactive window:\nPython\n>>>\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\n>>>\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nBrowser\nobjects represent the headless web browser. You can use them to request a page from the Internet by passing a URL to their\n.get()\nmethod:\nPython\n>>>\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\n>>>\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nurl\n)\npage\nis a\nResponse\nobject that stores the response from requesting the URL from the browser:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n<Response [200]>\nThe number\n200\nrepresents the\nstatus code\nreturned by the request. A status code of\n200\nmeans that the request was successful. An unsuccessful request might show a status code of\n404\nif the URL doesn\u2019t exist or\n500\nif there\u2019s a server error when making the request.\nMechanicalSoup uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML from the request, and\npage\nhas a\n.soup\nattribute that represents a\nBeautifulSoup\nobject:\nPython\n>>>\ntype\n(\npage\n.\nsoup\n)\n<class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'>\nYou can view the HTML by inspecting the\n.soup\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\npage\n.\nsoup\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Log In</title>\n</head>\n<body bgcolor=\"yellow\">\n<center>\n<br/><br/>\n<h2>Please log in to access Mount Olympus:</h2>\n<br/><br/>\n<form action=\"/login\" method=\"post\" name=\"login\">\nUsername: <input name=\"user\" type=\"text\"/><br/>\nPassword: <input name=\"pwd\" type=\"password\"/><br/><br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"/>\n</form>\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\nNotice this page has a\n<form>\non it with\n<input>\nelements for a username and a password.\nRemove ads\nSubmit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nOpen the\n/login\npage from the previous example in a browser and look at it yourself before moving on:\nTry typing in a random username and password combination. If you guess incorrectly, then the message\nWrong username or password!\nis displayed at the bottom of the page.\nHowever, if you provide the correct login credentials, then you\u2019re redirected to the\n/profiles\npage:\nUsername\nPassword\nzeus\nThunderDude\nIn the next example, you\u2019ll see how to use MechanicalSoup to fill out and submit this form using Python!\nThe important section of HTML code is the login form\u2014that is, everything inside the\n<form>\ntags. The\n<form>\non this page has the\nname\nattribute set to\nlogin\n. This form contains two\n<input>\nelements, one named\nuser\nand the other named\npwd\n. The third\n<input>\nelement is the\nSubmit\nbutton.\nNow that you know the underlying structure of the login form, as well as the credentials needed to log in, take a look at a program that fills the form out and submits it.\nIn a new editor window, type in the following program:\nPython\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\n# 1\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nurl\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\nlogin_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nurl\n)\nlogin_html\n=\nlogin_page\n.\nsoup\n# 2\nform\n=\nlogin_html\n.\nselect\n(\n\"form\"\n)[\n0\n]\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n0\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"zeus\"\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n1\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"ThunderDude\"\n# 3\nprofiles_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nsubmit\n(\nform\n,\nlogin_page\n.\nurl\n)\nSave the file and press\nF5\nto run it. To confirm that you\u2019ve successfully logged in, type the following into the interactive window:\nPython\n>>>\nprofiles_page\n.\nurl\n'http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles'\nNow break down the above example:\nYou create a\nBrowser\ninstance and use it to request the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login\n. You assign the HTML content of the page to the\nlogin_html\nvariable using the\n.soup\nproperty.\nlogin_html.select(\"form\")\nreturns a list of all\n<form>\nelements on the page. Because the page has only one\n<form>\nelement, you can access the form by retrieving the element at index\n0\nof the list. When there is only one form on a page, you may also use\nlogin_html.form\n. The next two lines select the username and password inputs and set their value to\n\"zeus\"\nand\n\"ThunderDude\"\n, respectively.\nYou submit the form with\nbrowser.submit()\n. Notice that you pass two arguments to this method, the\nform\nobject and the URL of the\nlogin_page\n, which you access via\nlogin_page.url\n.\nIn the interactive window, you confirm that the submission successfully redirected to the\n/profiles\npage. If something had gone wrong, then the value of\nprofiles_page.url\nwould still be\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\n.\nNote:\nHackers can use automated programs like the one above to\nbrute force\nlogins by rapidly trying many different usernames and passwords until they find a working combination.\nBesides this being highly illegal, almost all websites these days lock you out and report your IP address if they see you making too many failed requests, so don\u2019t try it!\nNow that you have the\nprofiles_page\nvariable set, it\u2019s time to programmatically obtain the URL for each link on the\n/profiles\npage.\nTo do this, you use\n.select()\nagain, this time passing the string\n\"a\"\nto select all the\n<a>\nanchor elements on the page:\nPython\n>>>\nlinks\n=\nprofiles_page\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"a\"\n)\nNow you can iterate over each link and print the\nhref\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks\n:\n...\naddress\n=\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\n...\ntext\n=\nlink\n.\ntext\n...\nprint\n(\nf\n\"\n{\ntext\n}\n:\n{\naddress\n}\n\"\n)\n...\nAphrodite: /profiles/aphrodite\nPoseidon: /profiles/poseidon\nDionysus: /profiles/dionysus\nThe URLs contained in each\nhref\nattribute are relative URLs, which aren\u2019t very helpful if you want to navigate to them later using MechanicalSoup. If you happen to know the full URL, then you can assign the portion needed to construct a full URL.\nIn this case, the base URL is just\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org\n. Then you can concatenate the base URL with the relative URLs found in the\nsrc\nattribute:\nPython\n>>>\nbase_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org\"\n>>>\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks\n:\n...\naddress\n=\nbase_url\n+\nlink\n[\n\"href\"\n]\n...\ntext\n=\nlink\n.\ntext\n...\nprint\n(\nf\n\"\n{\ntext\n}\n:\n{\naddress\n}\n\"\n)\n...\nAphrodite: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite\nPoseidon: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/poseidon\nDionysus: http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysus\nYou can do a lot with just\n.get()\n,\n.select()\n, and\n.submit()\n. That said, MechanicalSoup is capable of much more. To learn more about MechanicalSoup, check out the\nofficial docs\n.\nRemove ads\nCheck Your Understanding\nExpand the block below to check your understanding\nExercise: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nShow/Hide\nUse MechanicalSoup to provide the correct username (\nzeus\n) and password (\nThunderDude\n) to the\nlogin form\nlocated at the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login\n.\nOnce the form is submitted, display the title of the current page to determine that you\u2019ve been redirected to the\n/profiles\npage.\nYour program should print the text\n<title>All Profiles</title>\n.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoup\nShow/Hide\nFirst, import the\nmechanicalsoup\npackage and create a\nBroswer\nobject:\nPython\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nPoint the browser to the login page by passing the URL to\nbrowser.get()\nand grab the HTML with the\n.soup\nattribute:\nPython\nlogin_url\n=\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\"\nlogin_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\nlogin_url\n)\nlogin_html\n=\nlogin_page\n.\nsoup\nlogin_html\nis a\nBeautifulSoup\ninstance. Because the page has only a single form on it, you can access the form via\nlogin_html.form\n. Using\n.select()\n, select the username and password inputs and fill them with the username\n\"zeus\"\nand the password\n\"ThunderDude\"\n:\nPython\nform\n=\nlogin_html\n.\nform\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n0\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"zeus\"\nform\n.\nselect\n(\n\"input\"\n)[\n1\n][\n\"value\"\n]\n=\n\"ThunderDude\"\nNow that the form is filled out, you can submit it with\nbrowser.submit()\n:\nPython\nprofiles_page\n=\nbrowser\n.\nsubmit\n(\nform\n,\nlogin_page\n.\nurl\n)\nIf you filled the form with the correct username and password, then\nprofiles_page\nshould actually point to the\n/profiles\npage. You can confirm this by printing the title of the page assigned to\nprofiles_page:\nPython\nprint\n(\nprofiles_page\n.\nsoup\n.\ntitle\n)\nYou should see the following text displayed:\nShell\n<title>All Profiles</title>\nIf instead you see the text\nLog In\nor something else, then the form submission failed.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nInteract With Websites in Real Time\nSometimes you want to be able to fetch real-time data from a website that offers continually updated information.\nIn the dark days before you learned Python programming, you had to sit in front of a browser, clicking the\nRefresh\nbutton to reload the page each time you wanted to check if updated content was available. But now you can automate this process using the\n.get()\nmethod of the MechanicalSoup\nBrowser\nobject.\nOpen your browser of choice and navigate to the URL\nhttp://olympus.realpython.org/dice\n:\nThis\n/dice\npage simulates a roll of a six-sided die, updating the result each time you refresh the browser. Below, you\u2019ll write a program that repeatedly scrapes the page for a new result.\nThe first thing you need to do is determine which element on the page contains the result of the die roll. Do this now by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting\nView page source\n. A little more than halfway down the HTML code is an\n<h2>\ntag that looks like this:\nHTML\n<\nh2\nid\n=\n\"result\"\n>\n3\n</\nh2\n>\nThe text of the\n<h2>\ntag might be different for you, but this is the page element you need for scraping the result.\nNote:\nFor this example, you can easily check that there\u2019s only one element on the page with\nid=\"result\"\n. Although the\nid\nattribute is supposed to be unique, in practice you should always check that the element you\u2019re interested in is uniquely identified.\nNow start by writing a simple program that opens the\n/dice\npage, scrapes the result, and prints it to the console:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\nThis example uses the\nBeautifulSoup\nobject\u2019s\n.select()\nmethod to find the element with\nid=result\n. The string\n\"#result\"\n, which you pass to\n.select()\n, uses the\nCSS ID selector\n#\nto indicate that\nresult\nis an\nid\nvalue.\nTo periodically get a new result, you\u2019ll need to create a loop that loads the page at each step. So everything below the line\nbrowser = mechanicalsoup.Browser()\nin the above code needs to go in the body of the loop.\nFor this example, you want four rolls of the dice at ten-second intervals. To do that, the last line of your code needs to tell Python to pause running for ten seconds. You can do this with\n.sleep()\nfrom Python\u2019s\ntime\nmodule\n. The\n.sleep()\nmethod takes a single argument that represents the amount of time to sleep in seconds.\nHere\u2019s an example that illustrates how\nsleep()\nworks:\nPython\nimport\ntime\nprint\n(\n\"I'm about to wait for five seconds...\"\n)\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n5\n)\nprint\n(\n\"Done waiting!\"\n)\nWhen you run this code, you\u2019ll see that the\n\"Done waiting!\"\nmessage isn\u2019t displayed until five seconds have passed from when the first\nprint()\nfunction was executed.\nFor the die roll example, you\u2019ll need to pass the number\n10\nto\nsleep()\n. Here\u2019s the updated program:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\ntime\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nfor\ni\nin\nrange\n(\n4\n):\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n10\n)\nWhen you run the program, you\u2019ll immediately see the first result printed to the console. After ten seconds, the second result is displayed, then the third, and finally the fourth. What happens after the fourth result is printed?\nThe program continues running for another ten seconds before it finally stops. That\u2019s kind of a waste of time! You can stop it from doing this by using an\nif\nstatement\nto run\ntime.sleep()\nfor only the first three requests:\nPython\nmech_soup.py\nimport\ntime\nimport\nmechanicalsoup\nbrowser\n=\nmechanicalsoup\n.\nBrowser\n()\nfor\ni\nin\nrange\n(\n4\n):\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nget\n(\n\"http://olympus.realpython.org/dice\"\n)\ntag\n=\npage\n.\nsoup\n.\nselect\n(\n\"#result\"\n)[\n0\n]\nresult\n=\ntag\n.\ntext\nprint\n(\nf\n\"The result of your dice roll is:\n{\nresult\n}\n\"\n)\n# Wait 10 seconds if this isn't the last request\nif\ni\n<\n3\n:\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n10\n)\nWith techniques like this, you can scrape data from websites that periodically update their data. However, you should be aware that requesting a page multiple times in rapid succession can be seen as suspicious, or even malicious, use of a website.\nImportant:\nMost websites publish a Terms of Use document. You can often find a link to it in the website\u2019s footer.\nAlways read this document before attempting to scrape data from a website. If you can\u2019t find the Terms of Use, then try to contact the website owner and ask them if they have any policies regarding request volume.\nFailure to comply with the Terms of Use could result in your IP being blocked, so be careful!\nIt\u2019s even possible to crash a server with an excessive number of requests, so you can imagine that many websites are concerned about the volume of requests to their server! Always check the Terms of Use and be respectful when sending multiple requests to a website.\nRemove ads\nConclusion\nAlthough it\u2019s possible to parse data from the Web using tools in Python\u2019s standard library, there are many tools on PyPI that can help simplify the process.\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to:\nRequest a web page using Python\u2019s built-in\nurllib\nmodule\nParse HTML using\nBeautiful Soup\nInteract with web forms using\nMechanicalSoup\nRepeatedly request data from a website to\ncheck for updates\nWriting automated web scraping programs is fun, and the Internet has no shortage of content that can lead to all sorts of exciting projects.\nJust remember, not everyone wants you pulling data from their web servers.

Or how some websites and web applications can extract and display data so seamlessly from other sites in real-time? Whether you want to collect and track prices from e-commerce sites, gather news articles and research data, or monitor social media trends, web scraping is the tool you need.\nIn this tutorial, we'll explore the world of web scraping with Python, guiding you from the basics for beginners to advanced techniques for web scraping experts. In my experience, Python is a powerful tool for automating data extraction from websites and one of the most powerful and versatile languages for web scraping, thanks to its vast array of libraries and frameworks.\nConsider this a follow-up to our previous guide on\nhow to scrape the web without getting blocked\n. This time, we'll equip you with the knowledge to pick the perfect tool for the job, complete with the pros and cons of each method, real-world examples, and a sprinkle of hard-earned wisdom from yours truly.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of Python web scraping and be ready to scrape the web like a pro. Let's get started!\nJust a heads-up, we'll be assuming you're using Python3 throughout this code-filled odyssey.\nCheat Code:\nUse our Web Scraping API which makes it easy to scrape any website.\nSign up and get 1,000 free Web Scraping credits\nand easily build a Python web scraper with only a few clicks in our request builder.\n0. Web Scraping Process\nWeb scraping can seem daunting at first, but following a structured approach can significantly simplify the process. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, following these steps when scraping a website will ensure a smooth and efficient scraping process.\nStep 1: Understanding the Website's Structure\nBefore we start scraping, let's get to know the website's structure. First, we need to inspect the HTML source code of the web page to identify the elements we want to scrape.\nOnce we find these elements, we need to identify the HTML tags and attributes that hold our treasures.\nStep 2: Setting Up Our Python Playground\nLet's make sure we have Python3 installed on our machine. If not, we can grab it from the\nofficial Python website\n.\nNow that Python's ready to go, we should create a virtual environment to keep things organized. This way, our scraping project won't mess with other projects on our machine. Think of it as a designated sandbox for our web-scraping adventures!\nHere's how to create one:\npython -m venv scraping-env\nsource scraping-env/bin/activate\n# On Windows use `scraping-env\\Scripts\\activate`\nStep 3: Choosing Your Web Scraping Tool\nIf you're a web scraping newbie, then I highly recommend starting with the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. They're super easy to use and understand, kind of like training wheels for our web-scraping bike.\nYou can learn more about these awesome tools in the\nRequests & BeautifulSoup\nsection.\nStep 4: Handling Pagination and Dynamic Content\nWebsites can be tricky sometimes. They might have multiple pages of data we need, or the content might change and flicker like a firefly (we call this dynamic content). Not to worry!\nWe'll employ tools like Selenium in the\nHeadless Browsing\nsection to handle pagination and scrape websites that use JavaScript.\nStep 5: Respect the Website's Robots.txt and Legal Guidelines\nEvery website has rules, and web scraping is no exception. Before we start scraping, it's important to check the website's\nrobots.txt\nfile. This file tells us what parts of the website are okay to scrape and which ones are off-limits.\nThink of it as a treasure map that shows us where to dig and where not to! We also always want to make sure our scraping follows the website's terms of service and legal guidelines. It's all about being a good web scraping citizen.\nStep 6: Optimizing and Scaling Your Scraper\nAs you become more comfortable with web scraping, you can take your scraper to the next level! We can optimize it to run faster and scrape even larger amounts of data. Frameworks like\nScrapy\nand\nAsyncio\ncan help us with these complex tasks.\nPro Tip:\nFor web scraping beginners, Requests and BeautifulSoup are your best buddies. They're easy to use and will set you on the right path to web scraping mastery. You can learn more about these tools in the\nRequests & BeautifulSoup\nsection, so be sure to check it out!\n\ud83d\udca1 Love BeautifulSoup?

Manually Opening a Socket and Sending the HTTP Request\nSocket\nIn the early days of my web scraping journey, I learned the most basic way to perform an\nHTTP request\nin Python: manually opening a TCP socket and then sending the HTTP request. It's a bit like crafting things from scratch \u2013 sure, you get a deep appreciation for the nuts and bolts, but let's be honest, it can be a bit\u2026well\u2026socket-work.\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\nimport\nsocket\nHOST\n=\n'www.google.com'\n# Server hostname or IP address\nPORT\n=\n80\n# The standard port for HTTP is 80, for HTTPS it is 443\nclient_socket\n=\nsocket\n.\nsocket(socket\n.\nAF_INET, socket\n.\nSOCK_STREAM)\nserver_address\n=\n(HOST, PORT)\nclient_socket\n.\nconnect(server_address)\nrequest_header\n=\nb\n'GET / HTTP/1.0\n\\r\\n\nHost: www.google.com\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\n'\nclient_socket\n.\nsendall(request_header)\nresponse\n=\n''\nwhile\nTrue\n:\nrecv\n=\nclient_socket\n.\nrecv(\n1024\n)\nif\nnot\nrecv:\nbreak\nresponse\n+=\nrecv\n.\ndecode(\n'utf-8'\n)\nprint(response)\nclient_socket\n.\nclose()\nPro Tip:\nWhile wrangling sockets and parsing raw HTTP responses by hand is a fantastic learning experience (and a real eye-opener into how web requests tick under the hood!), it can also get cumbersome pretty quickly. For most web scraping tasks, libraries like\nRequests\nare our knight in shining armor, simplifying the process by leaps and bounds.\nNow that we've built our connection to the server, sent our HTTP request, and received the response, it's time to wrangle some data! In the good ol' days, regular expressions (regex) were my trusty companions for this quest.\nRegular Expressions\nWhen I first started parsing HTML responses manually, regular expressions (regex) were invaluable for searching, parsing, manipulating, and handling text. They allow us to define search patterns and are extremely useful for extracting specific data from text, such as prices, dates, numbers, or names. For example, we could quickly identify all phone numbers on a web page.\nCombined with classic\nsearch\nand\nreplace\n, regular expressions also allow us to perform string substitution on dynamic strings in a relatively straightforward fashion. The easiest example, in a web scraping context, may be to replace uppercase tags in a poorly formatted HTML document with the proper lowercase counterparts.\nBut hey, you might be thinking: \"With all these fancy Python modules for parsing HTML with XPath and CSS selectors, why even bother with regex?\" Let's be honest. That's a fair question!\nIn a perfect world, data would be neatly tucked away inside HTML elements with clear labels. But the web is rarely perfect. Sometimes, we'll find mountains of text crammed into basic\n<p>\nelements. To extract specific data (like a price, date, or name) from this messy landscape, we'll need to wield the mighty regex.\nNote:\nBeyond the basics that we'll discuss, regular expressions can be more complex, but tools like\nregex101.com\ncan help you test and debug your patterns. Additionally,\nRexEgg\nis an excellent resource to learn more about regex.\nFor example, regular expressions can be useful when we've an HTML snippet with this kind of data:\n<\np\n>Price : 19.99$</\np\n>\nWe could select this text node with an XPath expression and then use this kind of regex to extract the price:\nPrice\\s*:\\s*(\\d+\\.\\d{2})\\$\nHowever, if we only have the HTML snippet, fear not! It's not much trickier than catching a well-fed cat napping. We can simply specify the HTML tag in our expression and use a capturing group for the text:\nimport\nre\nhtml_content\n=\n'<p>Price : 19.99$</p>'\npattern\n=\nr\n'Price\\s*:\\s*(\\d+\\.\\d\n{2}\n)\\$'\nmatch\n=\nre\n.\nsearch(pattern, html_content)\nif\nmatch\n:\nprint(\nmatch\n.\ngroup(\n1\n))\n# Output: 19.99\nAs you can see, building HTTP requests with sockets and parsing responses with regex is a fundamental skill that unlocks a deeper understanding of web scraping. However, regex isn't a magic solution. It can get tangled and tricky to maintain, especially when dealing with complex or nested HTML structures.\nIn my professional experience, it's best to reach for dedicated HTML parsing libraries like\nBeautifulSoup or Requests\nwhenever possible. These libraries offer robust and flexible tools for navigating and extracting data from even the most unruly HTML documents.\n2. Using Urllib3 & LXML\nUrllib3\nNote:\nWorking with HTTP requests in Python can sometimes be confusing due to the various libraries available. While the standard library includes urllib and urllib2, urllib3 stands out for its ease of use and flexibility. Although urllib3 is not part of the standard library, it's widely adopted in the Python community, powering popular packages like\npip\nand Requests.\nWant to send HTTP requests, receive responses? urllib3 is our genie. And the best part? It does all this with way fewer lines of code than, say, wrestling with sockets directly.\nRemember that convoluted socket code from before? urllib3 lets us achieve the same thing with way less hassle:\nimport\nurllib3\nhttp\n=\nurllib3\n.\nPoolManager()\nr\n=\nhttp\n.\nrequest(\n'GET'\n,\n'http://www.google.com'\n)\nprint(r\n.\ndata)\nJust look at this! Isn't that so much cleaner than that socket business we talked about earlier? urllib3 boasts a super clean API, making it a breeze to not only send requests but also add fancy HTTP headers, use proxies, and even send those tricky POST forms.\nFor instance, had we decided to set some headers and use a\nproxy\n, we would only have to do the following:\nimport\nurllib3\nuser_agent_header\n=\nurllib3\n.\nmake_headers(user_agent\n=\n\"<USER AGENT>\"\n)\npool\n=\nurllib3\n.\nProxyManager(\n'<PROXY IP>'\n, headers\n=\nuser_agent_header)\nr\n=\npool\n.\nrequest(\n'GET'\n,\n'https://www.google.com/'\n)\nSee what I mean? Same number of lines, but way more functionality!\nNow, don't get me wrong, urllib3 isn't perfect. There are some things it doesn't handle quite as smoothly. Adding cookies, for instance, requires a bit more manual work, crafting those headers just right. But hey, on the flip side, urllib3 shines in areas where Requests might struggle. Managing connection pools, proxy pools, and even retry strategies? urllib3 is our champion.\nIn a nutshell, urllib3 is more advanced than raw sockets but is still a tad simpler than Requests.\nPro Tip:\nIf you're new to web scraping with Python, then Requests might be your best bet. Its user-friendly API is perfect for beginners. But once you're ready to level up your HTTP game, urllib3 is there to welcome you with open arms (and fewer lines of code).\nNext, to parse the response, we're going to use the lxml library and XPath expressions.\nXPath\nWe've all heard of\nCSS selectors\n, right? XPath is like its super-powered cousin. It uses path expressions to navigate and snag the exact data we need from an XML or HTML document.\nNote:\nAs with the Document Object Model, XPath has been a W3C standard since 1999. Although XPath is not a programming language per se, but it allows us to write expressions that can directly access a specific node, or a specific node-set, without having to go through the entire HTML or XML tree.\nHere are 3 things we need to extract data from an HTML document with XPath:\nAn HTML document\nXPath expressions\nAn XPath engine (like lxml) to run those expressions\nTo begin, we'll use the HTML we got from urllib3.\nAnd now, let's extract all the links from the Google homepage. We'll use a simple XPath expression:\n//a\n. This tells our engine to find all the anchor tags\n(<a>)\non the page, which is where those sweet, sweet links live.\nInstalling LXML\nNow, to make this magic happen, we need to install a library called\nlxml\n. It's a fast and easy to use XML and HTML processing library that supports XPath.\nTherefore, let's install\nlxml\nfirst:\npip install lxml\nRunning XPath Expressions\nSince we're parsing the response from our previous output, we can continue the code from where we stopped:\n# ... Previous snippet here\nfrom\nlxml\nimport\nhtml\n# We reuse the response from urllib3\ndata_string\n=\nr\n.\ndata\n.\ndecode(\n'utf-8'\n, errors\n=\n'ignore'\n)\n# We instantiate a tree object from the HTML\ntree\n=\nhtml\n.\nfromstring(data_string)\n# We run the XPath against this HTML\n# This returns an array of elements\nlinks\n=\ntree\n.\nxpath(\n'//a'\n)\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks:\n# For each element we can easily get back the URL\nprint(link\n.\nget(\n'href'\n))\nAnd the output should look like this:\nhttps:\n//\nbooks\n.\ngoogle\n.\nfr\n/\nbkshp\n?\nhl\n=\nfr\n&\ntab\n=\nwp\nhttps:\n//\nwww\n.\ngoogle\n.\nfr\n/\nshopping\n?\nhl\n=\nfr\n&\nsource\n=\nog\n&\ntab\n=\nwf\nhttps:\n//\nwww\n.\nblogger\n.\ncom\n/\n?\ntab\n=\nwj\nhttps:\n//\nphotos\n.\ngoogle\n.\ncom\n/\n?\ntab\n=\nwq\n&\npageId\n=\nnone\nhttp:\n//\nvideo\n.\ngoogle\n.\nfr\n/\n?\nhl\n=\nfr\n&\ntab\n=\nwv\nhttps:\n//\ndocs\n.\ngoogle\n.\ncom\n/\ndocument\n/\n?\nusp\n=\ndocs_alc\n...\nhttps:\n//\nwww\n.\ngoogle\n.\nfr\n/\nintl\n/\nfr\n/\nabout\n/\nproducts\n?\ntab\n=\nwh\nThis is a super basic example. XPath can get pretty darn complex, but that just means it's even more powerful!\nNote:\nWe could have also used\n//a/@href\nto point straight to the\nhref\nattribute). You can get up to speed about XPath with this\nhelpful introduction from MDN Web Docs\n. The\nlxml documentation\nis also well-written and is a good starting point.\nCopying Our Target XPath from Chrome Dev Tools\nOpen Chrome Dev Tools (press F12 key or right-click on the webpage and select \"Inspect\")\nUse the element selector tool to highlight the element you want to scrape\nRight-click the highlighted element in the Dev Tools panel\nSelect \"Copy\" and then \"Copy XPath\"\nPaste the XPath expression into the code\nPro Tip:\nIn my experience, XPath expressions, like regular expressions, are powerful and one of the fastest ways to extract information from HTML. However, like regular expressions, XPath can also quickly become messy, hard to read, and hard to maintain. So, keep your expressions clean and well-documented to avoid future headaches.\nLearn more about XPath for web scraping in our separate blog post\nand our\nXpath cheat sheet\n.\n3. Using Requests & BeautifulSoup\nRequests\nI started building web scrapers in Python, and let me tell you,\nRequests\nquickly became my go-to library. It's the undisputed king of making HTTP requests, with over 11 million downloads under its belt. Think of it as \"Everything HTTP for Humans\" \u2013 scraping has never been so user-friendly!\nInstalling Requests\nTo get started with Requests, first, we have to install it:\npip install requests\nNow we're ready to make requests with Requests (see what I did there?). Here's a simple example:\nimport\nrequests\nr\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(\n'https://www.scrapingninja.co'\n)\nprint(r\n.\ntext)\nWith Requests, it's easy to perform POST requests, handle cookies, and manage query parameters.\nFurthermore, don't be surprised that we can even\ndownload images with Requests\n:\nimport\nrequests\nurl\n=\n'https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_light_color_272x92dp.png'\nresponse\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(url)\nwith\nopen(\n'image.jpg'\n,\n'wb'\n)\nas\nfile:\nfile\n.\nwrite(response\n.\ncontent)\nThat's the power of Requests in a nutshell. Need to scrape the web at scale? Check out our guide on\nPython Requests With Proxies\n\u2013 it's a game-changer!\nAuthentication to Hacker News\nLet's say we want to build a scraper that submits our blog posts to\nHacker News\n(or any other forum). To do that, we need to log in. Here's where Requests and BeautifulSoup come in handy.\nTo start, let's take a quick look at the\nHacker News login form\nand the associated DOM:\nWe're looking for those special\n<input>\ntags with the\nname\nattribute \u2013 they're the key to sending our login information.\nHere, there are three\n<input>\ntags with a\nname\nattribute (other input elements are not sent) on this form. The first one has a type\nhidden\nwith a name\ngoto\n, and the two others are the\nusername\nand\npassword\n.\nWhen we submit the form in our browser, cookies are sent back and forth, keeping the server informed that we're logged in.\nRequests handles these cookies beautifully (pun intended) with its\nSession\nobject.\nBeautifulSoup\nThe next thing we need is BeautifulSoup. It's a Python library that helps us parse HTML and XML documents to extract data.\nInstalling BeautifulSoup\nJust like Requests, getting BeautifulSoup is a snap:\npip install beautifulsoup4\nNow we can use BeautifulSoup to dissect the HTML returned by the server and see if we've successfully logged in. All we have to do is\nPOST\nour three\ninputs\nwith our credentials to the\n/login\nendpoint and sniff around for an element that only appears after logging in:\nimport\nrequests\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nBASE_URL\n=\n'https://news.ycombinator.com'\nUSERNAME\n=\n\"\"\nPASSWORD\n=\n\"\"\ns\n=\nrequests\n.\nSession()\ndata\n=\n{\n\"goto\"\n:\n\"news\"\n,\n\"acct\"\n: USERNAME,\n\"pw\"\n: PASSWORD}\nr\n=\ns\n.\npost(\nf\n'\n{\nBASE_URL\n}\n/login'\n, data\n=\ndata)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(r\n.\ntext,\n'html.parser'\n)\nif\nsoup\n.\nfind(id\n=\n'logout'\n)\nis\nnot\nNone\n:\nprint(\n'Successfully logged in'\n)\nelse\n:\nprint(\n'Authentication Error'\n)\nFantastic! With only a few lines of Python code, we've logged in to Hacker News and checked if the login was successful. Feel free to try this with any other site.\nNow, on to the next challenge: getting all the links on the homepage.\nScraping the Hacker News Homepage\nHacker News boasts a powerful\nAPI\n, but for this example, we'll use scraping to showcase the process.\nFirst, let's examine the Hacker News homepage to understand its structure and identify the CSS classes we need to target:\nWe see that each post is wrapped in a\n<tr>\ntag with the class\nathing\n. Easy enough! Let's grab all these tags in one fell swoop:\nlinks\n=\nsoup\n.\nfindAll(\n'tr'\n, class_\n=\n'athing'\n)\nThen, for each link, we'll extract its\nID\n,\ntitle\n,\nURL\n, and\nrank\n:\nimport\nrequests\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nr\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(\n'https://news.ycombinator.com'\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(r\n.\ntext,\n'html.parser'\n)\nlinks\n=\nsoup\n.\nfindAll(\n'tr'\n, class_\n=\n'athing'\n)\nformatted_links\n=\n[]\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks:\ndata\n=\n{\n'id'\n: link[\n'id'\n],\n'title'\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na\n.\ntext,\n\"url\"\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na[\n'href'\n],\n\"rank\"\n: int(link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n0\n]\n.\nspan\n.\ntext\n.\nreplace(\n'.'\n,\n''\n))\n}\nformatted_links\n.\nappend(data)\nprint(formatted_links)\nVoila! We've conquered the Hacker News homepage and retrieved details about all the posts.\nNote:\nWe've been scraping by with beautiful BeautifulSoup, and it's been a delicious experience! But what if we crave a bit more, a turbo boost for our scraping toolkit? Enter\nMechanicalSoup\n, the perfect blend of Requests' simplicity and BeautifulSoup's parsing power. Check out our guide on\nGetting started with MechanicalSoup\n.\nBut wait, there's more! Let's not just print this data and watch it disappear faster than a squirrel on a sugar rush.\nStoring our data in CSV\nTo save the scraped data to a CSV file, we can use Python's\ncsv\nmodule. Let's continue our code and save our\ndata\ninto a CSV file:\nimport\ncsv\n# Sample data\ndata\n=\n[\n{\n'id'\n:\n'1'\n,\n'title'\n:\n'Post 1'\n,\n'url'\n:\n'http://example.com/1'\n,\n'rank'\n:\n1\n},\n{\n'id'\n:\n'2'\n,\n'title'\n:\n'Post 2'\n,\n'url'\n:\n'http://example.com/2'\n,\n'rank'\n:\n2\n}\n]\n# Define the CSV file path\ncsv_file\n=\n'hacker_news_posts.csv'\n# Write data to CSV\nwith\nopen(csv_file,\n'w'\n, newline\n=\n''\n)\nas\nfile:\nwriter\n=\ncsv\n.\nDictWriter(file, fieldnames\n=\n[\n'id'\n,\n'title'\n,\n'url'\n,\n'rank'\n])\nwriter\n.\nwriteheader()\nfor\nrow\nin\ndata:\nwriter\n.\nwriterow(row)\nPro Tip:\nIn my experience, this combination of Requests, BeautifulSoup and the\ncsv\nmodule is perfect for beginners to build powerful web scrapers with minimal code. Once you're comfortable with these tools as a beginner, you can explore more advanced options like\nScrapy\nand\nSelenium\n.\nBut on our journey to the land of big data, our trusty CSV file might start to spin out of control. Fortunately, we have a secret weapon: databases! Let's level up our Python scraper and make it as robust as a knight in shining armor.\nStoring Our Data in PostgreSQL\nWe chose a good ol' relational database for our example here -\nPostgreSQL\n! With a database like PostgreSQL, we can make our data storage as strong as a dragon's hoard.\nStep 1: Installing PostgreSQL\nFor starters, we'll need a functioning database instance. Check out\nPostgreSQL Download Page\nfor that, and pick the appropriate package for your operating system, and follow its installation instructions.\nStep 2: Creating a Database Table\nAfter installation, we'll need to\nset up a database\n(let's name it\nscrape_demo\n) and add a table for our Hacker News links to it (let's name that one\nhn_links\n) with the following schema:\nCREATE TABLE \"hn_links\" ( \"id\" INTEGER NOT NULL, \"title\" VARCHAR NOT NULL, \"url\" VARCHAR NOT NULL, \"rank\" INTEGER NOT NULL\n);\nNote:\nTo manage the database, we can either use PostgreSQL's own command line client (\npsql\n) or one of the available UI interfaces\n(PostgreSQL Clients\n).\nAll right, the database should be ready, and we can turn to our code again.\nStep 3: Installing Psycopg2 to Connect to PostgreSQL\nFirst thing, we need something that lets us talk to PostgreSQL and\nPsycopg2\nis a truly great library for that. As always, we can quickly install it with\npip\n:\npip install psycopg2\nThe rest is relatively easy and straightforward. We just need to establish a connection to our PostgreSQL database:\ncon\n=\npsycopg2\n.\nconnect(host\n=\n\"127.0.0.1\"\n, port\n=\n\"5432\"\n, user\n=\n\"postgres\"\n, password\n=\n\"\"\n, database\n=\n\"scrape_demo\"\n)\nAfter setting up the connection, we can insert data into the database.\nStep 4: Inserting Data into PostgreSQL\nOnce connected, we get a database cursor to execute SQL commands and insert data into the database:\ncur\n=\ncon\n.\ncursor()\nAnd once we've the cursor, we can use the method\nexecute\nto run our SQL command:\ncur\n.\nexecute(\n\"INSERT INTO table [HERE-GOES-OUR-DATA]\"\n)\nPerfect! We have stored everything in our database!\nStep 5: Committing the Data and Closing the Connection\nHold your horses, please. Before you ride off into the sunset, don't forget to\ncommit\nyour (implicit) database transaction \ud83d\ude09. One more\ncon.commit()\n(and a couple of\nclose\ns) and we're really good to go:\n# Commit the data\ncon\n.\ncommit();\n# Close our database connections\ncur\n.\nclose()\ncon\n.\nclose()\nNow, let\u2019s take a sneak peek at our data:\nAnd for the grand finale, here\u2019s the complete code, including the scraping logic from before and the database storage:\nimport\npsycopg2\nimport\nrequests\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\n# Establish database connection\ncon\n=\npsycopg2\n.\nconnect(\nhost\n=\n\"127.0.0.1\"\n,\nport\n=\n\"5432\"\n,\nuser\n=\n\"postgres\"\n,\npassword\n=\n\"\"\n,\ndatabase\n=\n\"scrape_demo\"\n)\n# Get a database cursor\ncur\n=\ncon\n.\ncursor()\nr\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(\n'https://news.ycombinator.com'\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(r\n.\ntext,\n'html.parser'\n)\nlinks\n=\nsoup\n.\nfindAll(\n'tr'\n, class_\n=\n'athing'\n)\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks:\ncur\n.\nexecute(\n\"\"\"\nINSERT INTO hn_links (id, title, url, rank)\nVALUES (\n%s\n,\n%s\n,\n%s\n,\n%s\n)\n\"\"\"\n,\n(\nlink[\n'id'\n],\nlink\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na\n.\ntext,\nlink\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na[\n'href'\n],\nint(link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n0\n]\n.\nspan\n.\ntext\n.\nreplace(\n'.'\n,\n''\n))\n)\n)\n# Commit the data\ncon\n.\ncommit()\n# Close our database connections\ncur\n.\nclose()\ncon\n.\nclose()\nWith that, we\u2019re done! Our data is safely tucked away in the database, ready for any analysis or processing we might have in mind. Nice work!\nSummary\nWhew! We've accomplished quite a bit. As we've seen, Requests and BeautifulSoup are fantastic libraries for extracting data and automating various tasks, like posting forms.\nHowever, if we're planning to run large-scale web scraping projects, we could still use Requests, but we'll need to handle many components ourselves.\n\ud83d\udca1 Did you know about\nScrapingBee's Data Extraction tools\n? Not only do they provide a complete no-code environment for your projects, but they also scale effortlessly and manage all advanced features, like JavaScript and proxy round-robin, right out of the box.\nCheck it out - the first 1,000 requests are on the house!\nIf you want to dive deeper into Python, BeautifulSoup, POST requests, HTML Parsers and particularly CSS selectors, I highly recommend these articles:\nBeautifulSoup tutorial: Scraping web pages with Python\nHow to send a POST with Python Requests?\nPython HTML Parsers Compared\nThe scraping world is full of opportunities for improvement. Here are some ways to make our scraper truly shine:\nParallelizing our code and making it faster by running multiple scraping tasks concurrently\nHandling errors by making our scraper robust with exception handling and retrying failed requests\nFiltering results to extract only the data we need\nThrottling requests to avoid overloading the server by adding delays between requests\nFortunately, tools exist that can handle these improvements for us. For large-scale projects, consider using web crawling frameworks such as\nScrapy\n.\nAsyncio\nRequests is fantastic, but for hundreds of pages, it might feel a bit sluggish. By default, Requests handles synchronous requests, meaning that each request is sent one by one.\nFor instance, if we've 25 URLs to scrape, each taking 10 seconds, it will take over four minutes to scrape all pages sequentially:\nimport\nrequests\n# An array with 25 urls\nurls\n=\n[\n...\n]\nfor\nurl\nin\nurls:\nresult\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(url)\nAsyncio\nto the rescue! This asynchronous I/O library in Python, along with\naiohttp\nfor asynchronous HTTP requests, allows us to send requests concurrently.\nInstead of waiting for each request to finish before sending the next, we can send them all (or many at once) and handle the responses asynchronously.\nStep 1: Installing the Aiohttp Library\nFirst, we'll need to install the aiohttp library, which works well with asyncio for making HTTP requests:\npip install aiohttp\nStep 2: Using Asyncio for Concurrent Requests\nAfter installation, we can now use asyncio and aiohttp to scrape multiple pages in parallel.\nFor example, we can scrape\nHacker News list pages\nasynchronously:\nimport\nasyncio\nimport\naiohttp\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\n# Asynchronous function to fetch the HTML content of the URL\nasync\ndef\nfetch\n(session, url):\nasync\nwith\nsession\n.\nget(url)\nas\nresponse:\nreturn\nawait\nresponse\n.\ntext()\n# Asynchronous function to fetch the HTML content of multiple URLs\nasync\ndef\nfetch_all\n(urls):\nasync\nwith\naiohttp\n.\nClientSession()\nas\nsession:\ntasks\n=\n[fetch(session, url)\nfor\nurl\nin\nurls]\nreturn\nawait\nasyncio\n.\ngather(\n*\ntasks)\n# Main function to fetch and parse the HTML content\nasync\ndef\nmain\n():\nurls\n=\n[\n'https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=1'\n]\n*\n25\n# Example: same URL for demonstration\nhtml_pages\n=\nawait\nfetch_all(urls)\nall_links\n=\n[]\nfor\nhtml\nin\nhtml_pages:\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(html,\n'html.parser'\n)\nlinks\n=\nsoup\n.\nfindAll(\n'tr'\n, class_\n=\n'athing'\n)\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks:\ndata\n=\n{\n'id'\n: link[\n'id'\n],\n'title'\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na\n.\ntext,\n'url'\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na[\n'href'\n],\n'rank'\n: int(link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n0\n]\n.\nspan\n.\ntext\n.\nreplace(\n'.'\n,\n''\n))\n}\nall_links\n.\nappend(data)\nfor\nlink\nin\nall_links:\nprint(\nf\n\"ID:\n{\nlink[\n'id'\n]\n}\n, Title:\n{\nlink[\n'title'\n]\n}\n, URL:\n{\nlink[\n'url'\n]\n}\n, Rank:\n{\nlink[\n'rank'\n]\n}\n\"\n)\n# Run the main function\nasyncio\n.\nrun(main())\nPro Tip:\nIn my experience, asyncio can dramatically reduce scraping time for multiple pages. It's a superhero for large scraping projects!\nAsyncio's secret weapon is its\nsingle-threaded\n, single-process design with event loops. This makes it super efficient, allowing us to handle hundreds of requests concurrently without overloading the system, making it highly scalable.\nFor features like JavaScript rendering or fancy proxy rotation, consider exploring scraping frameworks like\nScrapy\nor services like ScrapingBee. They'll help us conquer even the most complex scraping challenges!\nCheck out our full guide on\nhow to scrape with Asyncio and aiohttp\n.\n4. Using ScrapingBee Python Client\nIf you want an easy way to bypass any website\u2019s anti-scraping measures while not having to manage complex scraping infrastructure, we provide a\nPython Client Library\nthat makes it super convenient to make requests. Our API handles many common scraping operations such as JavaScript rendering, Proxy/IP rotation, and HTML parsing - so you don't have to. We also have an AI query feature, where you can extract structured data from any given URL without wrangling with the HTML structure and CSS/XPath selectors.\nLet's see a quick start example of our Python API client below using our blog on\nThe Best Python Web Scraping Libraries\nas a test case. We'll extract the title of the blog and the list of sections. To follow along, you will need a ScrapingBee API key\nwhich you can get here with 1,000 free credits.\nRegular Method: Using CSS Selectors\npip install scrapingbee\nfrom\nscrapingbee\nimport\nScrapingBeeClient\nimport\njson\n# Initialize the ScrapingBee Client\nsb_client\n=\nScrapingBeeClient(api_key\n=\n'YOUR_SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY'\n)\nURL\n=\n'https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/best-python-web-scraping-libraries/'\n# Extract Structured Data Using CSS selectors.\nresponse\n=\nsb_client\n.\nget(\nURL,\nparams\n=\n{\n'extract_rules'\n: {\n'title'\n:\n'h1'\n,\n'sections'\n: {\n'selector'\n:\n'h2'\n,\n'type'\n:\n'list'\n,\n'output'\n:\n'text'\n}\n}\n}\n)\ndata\n=\njson\n.\nloads(response\n.\ncontent)\nprint(json\n.\ndumps(data, indent\n=\n2\n))\n'''\nOUTPUT:\n{\n\"title\": \"7 Best Python Web Scraping Libraries for 2025\",\n\"sections\": [\n\"1.

The only difference is that we did not use CSS selectors and instead specified AI queries to extract structured data from the webpage. This can be very handy when you are scraping web pages from multiple websites with diverse HTML structures, or continuously scraping web pages over long time periods where the HTML structure could be changed.\nRead more about our AI Web Scraping Feature here.\nFor further reading on AI Web Scraping here are a couple of guides on how to do it:\nHow to Easily Scrape Any Shopify Store With AI\nFree AI Powered Proxy Scraper for Getting Fresh Public Proxies\n5. Using Web Crawling Frameworks\nScrapy\nScrapy is like a Swiss Army knife for web scraping and crawling, armed with Python power. I\u2019ve had my share of adventures with it, and trust me, it's got quite the arsenal.\nFrom downloading web pages asynchronously to managing and saving the content in various formats, Scrapy\u2019s got us covered. It supports multithreading, crawling (yep, the process of hopping from link to link to discover all URLs on a website like a digital spider), sitemaps, and a lot more.\nKey Features of Scrapy\nAsynchronous Requests\n: Handles multiple requests simultaneously, speeding up the scraping process\nBuilt-In Crawler\n: Automatically follows links and discovers new pages\nData Export\n: Exports data in various formats such as JSON, CSV, and XML\nMiddleware Support\n: Customize and extend Scrapy's functionality using middlewares\nAnd let's not forget the\nScrapy Shell\n, my secret weapon for testing code. With\nScrapy Shell\n, we can quickly test our scraping code and ensure our XPath expressions or CSS selectors work flawlessly.\nBut hold on to your hats, folks, because Scrapy's learning curve is steeper than a rollercoaster drop. There is a lot to learn!\nTo continue our example with Hacker News, we'll create a Scrapy Spider that scrapes the first 15 pages of Hacker News and save the data in a CSV file.\nStep 1: Installing Scrapy\nFirst things first, let\u2019s install Scrapy. It\u2019s a piece of cake with\npip\n:\npip install Scrapy\nStep 2: Generating Project Boilerplate\nAfter installation, we use the Scrapy CLI to generate the boilerplate code for our project:\nscrapy startproject hacker_news_scraper\nStep 3: Creating the Scrapy Spider\nInside the\nhacker_news_scraper/spiders\ndirectory, we'll create a new Python file with our spider's code:\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nimport\nscrapy\nclass\nHnSpider\n(scrapy\n.\nSpider):\nname\n=\n\"hacker-news\"\nallowed_domains\n=\n[\n\"news.ycombinator.com\"\n]\nstart_urls\n=\n[\nf\n'https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=\n{\ni\n}\n'\nfor\ni\nin\nrange(\n1\n,\n16\n)]\ndef\nparse\n(self, response):\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(response\n.\ntext,\n'html.parser'\n)\nlinks\n=\nsoup\n.\nfindAll(\n'tr'\n, class_\n=\n'athing'\n)\nfor\nlink\nin\nlinks:\nyield\n{\n'id'\n: link[\n'id'\n],\n'title'\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na\n.\ntext,\n'url'\n: link\n.\nfind_all(\n'td'\n)[\n2\n]\n.\na[\n'href'\n],\n'rank'\n: int(link\n.\ntd\n.\nspan\n.\ntext\n.\nreplace(\n'.'\n,\n''\n))\n}\nScrapy uses conventions extensively. Here, the\nstart_urls\nlist contains all the desired URLs. Scrapy then fetches each URL and calls the\nparse\nmethod for each\nresponse\n, where we use custom code to parse the HTML.\nStep 4: Configuring Scrapy Settings\nWe need to tweak Scrapy a bit to ensure our spider behaves politely with the target website. To do this, we should enable and configure the\nAutoThrottle\nextension in the Scrapy settings:\n# Enable and configure the AutoThrottle extension (disabled by default)\n# See https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html\nAUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED\n=\nTrue\n# The initial download delay\nAUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY\n=\n5\nNote:\nWe should always turn this on. This feature is like having a friendly spider that doesn\u2019t flood the site with requests. It automatically adjusts the request rate and the number of concurrent threads based on response times. We wouldn\u2019t want to be that annoying guest at a party, right?\nStep 5: Running the Spider\nNow, let\u2019s run the spider code with the Scrapy CLI and save the output in our desired formats (CSV, JSON, or XML). Here\u2019s how to save the data in a JSON file:\nscrapy crawl hacker\n-\nnews\n-\no links\n.\njson\nVoila! We now have all our links neatly packed in a JSON file. Scrapy does all the heavy lifting while we sit back and sip our coffee.\nThere\u2019s so much more to explore with Scrapy. If you\u2019re hungry for more knowledge, check out our dedicated blog post about\nweb scraping with Scrapy\n. It\u2019s a treasure trove of information!\nIf you love Scrapy also check out:\nScrapy Playwright Tutorial: How to Scrape Dynamic Websites\nScrapy competitor:\nCrawlee for Python Tutorial with Examples\nPySpider\nPySpider, an alternative to Scrapy, might feel like a hidden gem in the world of web crawling frameworks. Although its last update was in 2018, it still holds relevance today due to its unique features that Scrapy doesn\u2019t handle out of the box.\nWhy PySpider?\nPySpider outshines when it comes to handling JavaScript-heavy pages (think SPA and Ajax calls) because it includes PhantomJS, a headless browsing library. In contrast, Scrapy requires additional\nmiddlewares\nwe've to install to tackle JavaScript content.\nOn top of that, PySpider has a user-friendly UI that lets me keep an eye on all my crawling jobs:\nIf we decide to use PySpider, here is how to get it up and running.\nStep 1: Installing PySpider\nWe can install PySpider using\npip\n:\npip install pyspider\nIt\u2019s as easy as pie!\nStep 2. Starting the PySpider Components\nAfter installation, we need to start the necessary components:\nwebui\n,\nscheduler\n,\nfetcher\nand launch PySpider:\npyspider all\nStep 3: Accessing the Web UI\nOnce everything is up and running, we navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the PySpider interface. We\u2019ll find it quite intuitive and user-friendly.\nPySpider vs. Scrapy: A Quick Comparison\nAlthough PySpider has some cool features, there are several reasons why we might still lean towards Scrapy. Here\u2019s a quick comparison:\nFeature\nPySpider\nScrapy\nJavaScript Handling\nBuilt-in with PhantomJS\nRequires additional middlewares\nUser Interface\nYes\nNo\nDocumentation\nLimited\nExtensive with easy-to-understand guides\nHTTP Cache System\nNo\nYes, built-in\nHTTP Authentication\nNo\nAutomatic\nRedirection Support\nBasic\nFull support for 3XX and HTML meta refresh tags\nTo learn more about PySpider, check out the\nofficial documentation\n. Dive in and start crawling!\n6. Using Headless Browsing\nSelenium & Chrome\nScrapy is excellent for large-scale web scraping tasks. However, it struggles with sites that heavily use JavaScript or are implemented as Single Page Applications (SPAs). Scrapy only retrieves static HTML code and can't handle JavaScript on its own. So, all that fancy JavaScript goes to waste.\nThese SPAs can be tricky to scrape because of all the AJAX calls and WebSocket connections they use. If I'm worried about performance, I can use my browser's developer tools to look at all the network calls and copy the AJAX calls that have the data I'm after. But if there are just too many HTTP calls involved, it's easier to use a headless browser to render the page.\nHeadless browsers are perfect for taking screenshots of websites, and that's exactly what we're going to do with the Hacker News homepage (because, hey, who doesn't love Hacker News?). We'll use Selenium to lend us a hand.\nWeighing up which headless browser to use? Check out our guide on\nThe best headless browsers compared.\nWhen to Use Selenium\nScrapy is like that reliable old friend who\u2019s great for most things, but sometimes we need some extra muscle, especially when the website has tons of JavaScript code.\nHere are the three most common cases when we should summon Selenium:\nDelayed Content:\nWhen the data we need doesn't appear until a few seconds after the page loads\nJavaScript Everywhere:\nThe website is a JavaScript jungle\nJavaScript Blockades:\nThe site uses JavaScript checks to block \"classic\" HTTP clients and regular web scrapers\nSetting Up Selenium\nStep 1: Installing Selenium\nWe can install the Selenium package with\npip\n:\npip install selenium\nStep 2: Getting ChromeDriver\nWe also need ChromeDriver. For macOS, we can use\nbrew\nfor that:\nbrew install chromedriver\nOthers:\nDownload from\nChromeDriver\n.\nTaking a Screenshot With Selenium\nAfter getting our ChromeDriver, we just have to import the\nwebdriver\nfrom the\nselenium\npackage, configure Chrome with\nheadless=True\n, set a window size (otherwise it's really small), start Chrome, load the page, and finally get our beautiful screenshot:\nfrom\nselenium\nimport\nwebdriver\nfrom\nselenium.webdriver.chrome.options\nimport\nOptions\noptions\n=\nOptions()\noptions\n.\nheadless\n=\nTrue\noptions\n.\nadd_argument(\n\"--window-size=1920,1200\"\n)\ndriver\n=\nwebdriver\n.\nChrome(options\n=\noptions, executable_path\n=\n'/usr/local/bin/chromedriver'\n)\ndriver\n.\nget(\n\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\"\n)\ndriver\n.\nsave_screenshot(\n'hn_homepage.png'\n)\ndriver\n.\nquit()\nTrue, being good netizens, we also\nquit()\nthe\nwebdriver\ninstance of course. Now, we should get a nice screenshot of the homepage:\nAs we can see, we have a screenshot of the Hacker News homepage saved as\nhn_homepage.png\n.\nLet's see one more example.\nScraping Titles With Selenium\nSelenium is not just about taking screenshots. It's a full-fledged browser at our command that can scrape data rendered by JavaScript.\nLet's now scrape the titles of posts (class\ntitleline\n) on the Hacker News homepage:\nfrom\nselenium\nimport\nwebdriver\nfrom\nselenium.webdriver.chrome.options\nimport\nOptions\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nimport\nlogging\n# Set up logging to troubleshoot if anything goes wrong\nlogging\n.\nbasicConfig(level\n=\nlogging\n.\nINFO, format\n=\n'\n%(asctime)s\n-\n%(levelname)s\n-\n%(message)s\n'\n)\n# Set up headless Chrome options\noptions\n=\nOptions()\noptions\n.\nheadless\n=\nTrue\noptions\n.\nadd_argument(\n\"--window-size=1920,1200\"\n)\n# Initialize the WebDriver\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Initializing WebDriver\"\n)\ndriver\n=\nwebdriver\n.\nChrome(options\n=\noptions, executable_path\n=\n'/usr/local/bin/chromedriver'\n)\n# Load the Hacker News homepage\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Loading Hacker News homepage\"\n)\ndriver\n.\nget(\n\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\"\n)\n# Get page source and parse it with BeautifulSoup\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Parsing page source with BeautifulSoup\"\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(driver\n.\npage_source,\n'html.parser'\n)\n# Find all titles on the page (class - titleline)\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Finding all story titles on the page\"\n)\ntitles\n=\nsoup\n.\nfind_all(\n'span'\n, class_\n=\n'titleline'\n)\nif\ntitles:\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\nf\n\"Found\n{\nlen(titles)\n}\ntitles. Printing titles:\"\n)\n# Print each title\nfor\ntitle\nin\ntitles:\ntitle_link\n=\ntitle\n.\nfind(\n'a'\n)\nif\ntitle_link:\nprint(title_link\n.\ntext)\nelse\n:\nlogging\n.\nwarning(\n\"No titles found on the page.\"\n)\n# Close the driver\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Closing WebDriver\"\n)\ndriver\n.\nquit()\nHere, we launch a headless Chrome browser, load the Hacker News homepage, and retrieve the page source. Then, we use BeautifulSoup to\nparse\nand extract the titles.\nAdvanced Selenium Usage\nNaturally, there's a lot more we can do with the Selenium API and Chrome. After all, it's a full-blown browser instance:\nRunning JavaScript\nFilling forms\nClicking on elements\nExtracting elements with CSS selectors or XPath expressions\nFor more in-depth knowledge, don't hesitate to check out our\ndetailed guide on Selenium and Python\n.\nSelenium and Chrome in headless mode are the dynamic duo for scraping anything we can dream of. However, great power comes with great responsibility (and resource usage):\nMemory & CPU Usage:\nChrome, bless its heart, can gobble up memory before we realize. While some fine-tuning can shrink its footprint to a manageable 300-400MB per instance, each one still needs a dedicated CPU core.\nIf we need to run several instances concurrently, this will require a machine with an adequate hardware setup and enough memory to serve all our browser instances.\nFor a more lightweight solution or to avoid the complexity of managing multiple browser instances, consider using\nScrapingBee's site crawler SaaS\nplatform. It takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting for you.\nPlaywright & Firefox\nPlaywright\nis a modern framework for operating headless browsers developed by Microsoft. Functionally, the capabilities are similar to Selenium, but it has an easier learning curve. Additionally, for Python, it officially supports the latest\nasync/await\ncapabilities.\nFirefox is another popular browser that can be operated in headless mode for web scraping. While we demonstrate using Playwright with Firefox below, bear in mind that the framework and the browser are separate tools. So you can use Playwright with Chrome (or other browsers) or Selenium with Firefox too.\nWhen to Use Playwright\nIf you're starting fresh, Playwright can be used as a replacement for any task you would use Selenium for. It's also easier to setup.\nSetting Up Playwright\nStep 1: Installing Playwright\nWe can install the Playwright package with\npip\n:\npip install playwright\nStep 2: Getting Firefox\nThe next thing we need are the browser binaries. Playwright provides a command to get this:\nplaywright install firefox\nIf we want to install all the browsers that Playwright supports (chrome, webkit, and firefox), we can simply run\nplaywright install\n.\nTaking a Screenshot With Playwright\nLet's see the Playwright code for taking a screenshot of the HackerNews home page:\nfrom\nplaywright.sync_api\nimport\nsync_playwright\nwith\nsync_playwright()\nas\np:\nbrowser\n=\np\n.\nfirefox\n.\nlaunch()\n# headless by default\ncontext\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_context(viewport\n=\n{\n'width'\n:\n1920\n,\n'height'\n:\n1200\n})\npage\n=\ncontext\n.\nnew_page()\npage\n.\ngoto(\n\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\"\n)\npage\n.\nscreenshot(path\n=\n\"example-playwright.png\"\n)\nbrowser\n.\nclose()\nThis produces the exact same result as the previous Selenium example but feels much simpler to read.\nScraping Titles With Playwright\nNext, let's see how to get the titles with Playwright:\nfrom\nplaywright.sync_api\nimport\nsync_playwright\nfrom\nbs4\nimport\nBeautifulSoup\nimport\nlogging\n# Set up logging to troubleshoot if anything goes wrong\nlogging\n.\nbasicConfig(level\n=\nlogging\n.\nINFO, format\n=\n'\n%(asctime)s\n-\n%(levelname)s\n-\n%(message)s\n'\n)\nwith\nsync_playwright()\nas\np:\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n'Starting The Browser'\n)\nbrowser\n=\np\n.\nfirefox\n.\nlaunch()\n# headless by default\n# Load the Hacker News homepage\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Loading Hacker News homepage\"\n)\npage\n=\nbrowser\n.\nnew_page()\npage\n.\ngoto(\n\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\"\n)\n# Get page source and parse it with BeautifulSoup\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Parsing page source with BeautifulSoup\"\n)\nsoup\n=\nBeautifulSoup(page\n.\ncontent(),\n'html.parser'\n)\n# Find all titles on the page (class - titleline)\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Finding all story titles on the page\"\n)\ntitles\n=\nsoup\n.\nfind_all(\n'span'\n, class_\n=\n'titleline'\n)\nif\ntitles:\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\nf\n\"Found\n{\nlen(titles)\n}\ntitles. Printing titles:\"\n)\n# Print each title\nfor\ntitle\nin\ntitles:\ntitle_link\n=\ntitle\n.\nfind(\n'a'\n)\nif\ntitle_link:\nprint(title_link\n.\ntext)\nelse\n:\nlogging\n.\nwarning(\n\"No titles found on the page.\"\n)\n# Close the browser\nlogging\n.\ninfo(\n\"Closing the Browser\"\n)\nbrowser\n.\nclose()\nThe above code is functionally equivalent to the Selenium code we wrote in the previous section. The BeautifulSoup bits stay the same though. The syntax is easier to read and learn. While Playwright is newer than Selenium, it's worth learning the syntax as some advanced tools such as\nCamoufox\nare fully compatible with the Playwright API\n7. Using a Website\u2019s API\nSometimes, scraping a website\u2019s content can be as easy as interacting with its API.\u00a0No\u00a0need to wrestle with weird HTTP clients and website code or\u00a0need\u00a0a fancy browser in disguise.\nWe just need to find the API the website offers and then use it to grab the data we want.\nScraping a Website\u2019s Content API\nLet's see the steps to find and scrape a website\u2019s content API.\nStep 1: Identifying the API Endpoint\nMany websites provide official APIs. To find them, we can look for links to API documentation in the website\u2019s footer, developer section, or simply use search engines with queries like\n\"site:example.com API\"\n.\nAnother trick up our sleeve is using browser developer tools to inspect network requests while interacting with the website. We should look for API endpoints returning JSON or XML data, which often signals an API.\nStep 2: Understanding the API Documentation\nAPI documentation is our treasure map. We need to read through it to understand the available endpoints, required authentication, rate limits, and data formats.\nStep 3: Generating API Keys\nTo unlock the API's full potential, we need API keys. Sign up or log in to the website\u2019s developer portal, create an application, and specify a redirect URL to generate these keys.\nStep 4: Using cURL to Test API Requests\ncURL is our trusty command-line tool for making HTTP requests. We can use it to test API endpoints and understand the required parameters. Here is an example cURL command:\ncurl -X GET\n\"https://api.example.com/data?param=value\"\n-H\n\"Authorization: Bearer your_token\"\nStep 5: Converting cURL to Python Requests\nAfter pinpointing the necessary API request, it\u2019s time to convert the cURL command to Python code using the Requests library. Let\u2019s translate the above sample cURL command:\nimport\nrequests\nurl\n=\n\"https://api.example.com/data\"\nheaders\n=\n{\n\"Authorization\"\n:\n\"Bearer your_token\"\n}\nparams\n=\n{\n\"param\"\n:\n\"value\"\n}\nresponse\n=\nrequests\n.\nget(url, headers\n=\nheaders, params\n=\nparams)\ndata\n=\nresponse\n.\njson()\nprint(data)\nPro Tip:\nFrom my experience, using APIs is often more efficient than scraping HTML. We get the structured data straight from the source, all neat and organized, and it's less likely to break if the website changes its layout.\nCheck out our detailed\nhow to use curl in python\nguide to convert commands.\nScraping Reddit Data\nLet's set sail for Reddit and plunder some data with the amazing\nPRAW\nlibrary. It's a fantastic Python package that wraps the Reddit API in a nice, user-friendly way.\nStep 1: Installing PRAW\nFirst things first, we need to invite\npraw\nto our Python party. Let's send out the invitation:\npip install praw\nIt's as easy as pie. Or should we say, as easy as PRAW?\nStep 2: Getting Reddit API Credentials\nTo use the Reddit API, we need to create an application and obtain the necessary credentials. Go to\nReddit Apps\nand scroll to the bottom to create an application.\nAccording to\nPRAW's documentation\n, set\nhttp://localhost:8080\nas the \"redirect URL\".\nAfter clicking\ncreate app\n, the screen with the API details and credentials will load. For our example, we'll need the\nclient ID\n, the\nsecret\n, and the\nuser agent\n.\nStep 3: Scraping Data With PRAW\nNow, let's get our hands on the top 1,000 posts from the\n/r/Entrepreneur\nsubreddit. We're going to scoop up this data and export it into a shiny CSV file:\nimport\npraw\nimport\ncsv\n# Setup Reddit API credentials\nreddit\n=\npraw\n.\nReddit(client_id\n=\n'your_client_id'\n, client_secret\n=\n'your_secret'\n, user_agent\n=\n'top-1000-posts'\n)\n# Get the top 1,000 posts from the subreddit\ntop_posts\n=\nreddit\n.\nsubreddit(\n'Entrepreneur'\n)\n.\ntop(limit\n=\n1000\n)\n# Open a CSV file to write the data\nwith\nopen(\n'top_1000.csv'\n,\n'w'\n, newline\n=\n''\n)\nas\ncsvfile:\nfieldnames\n=\n[\n'title'\n,\n'score'\n,\n'num_comments'\n,\n'author'\n]\nwriter\n=\ncsv\n.\nDictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames\n=\nfieldnames)\nwriter\n.\nwriteheader()\nfor\npost\nin\ntop_posts:\nwriter\n.\nwriterow({\n'title'\n: post\n.\ntitle,\n'score'\n: post\n.\nscore,\n'num_comments'\n: post\n.\nnum_comments,\n'author'\n: str(post\n.\nauthor)\n})\nThe actual extraction part is a piece of cake (or maybe a piece of code). We're running\ntop\non the\nsubreddit\nand storing the posts in\ntop_posts\n. Voil\u00e0!\nThere are many other mystical and wonderful things we can do with PRAW. From analyzing subreddits in real-time with sentiment analysis libraries to predicting the next $GME, the possibilities are as endless as the scroll on our Reddit feed.\n\ud83d\udca1 Want to take the hassle out of scraping?\nLearn how to screen scrape with no infrastructure maintenance via our scraping API\n8. Avoiding Anti-Bot Technology\nOne of the biggest challenges we face on our scraping adventures is getting blocked by websites. They're getting better at spotting those pesky scraper bots.\nBut don't worry! Here are some tried-and-true methods to keep our scraping efforts under the radar. For a deep dive, check out our detailed article on\nhow to not get blocked while web scraping\n.\nCheck robots.txt using RobotParser\nThough not legally binding, the\n/robots.txt\nfile is indicative of how much a website is willing to let a bot crawl the site. It sometimes mentions the rate limits the site imposes on crawlers. It's worth checking if we can stay within these limits and still get our job done efficiently. This would save the time spent on bypassing anti-scraping measures.\nPython provides an inbuilt library (\nurllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser\n) to check the\nrobots.txt\nfile of any website for rate limits. We can use it as follows:\nimport\nurllib.robotparser\nrp\n=\nurllib\n.\nrobotparser\n.\nRobotFileParser()\nrp\n.\nset_url(\n\"https://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt\"\n)\nrp\n.\nread()\ndelay\n=\nrp\n.\ncrawl_delay(\n\"*\"\n)\nprint(delay)\n# prints 30\nThe above piece of code checks the HackerNews\nrobots.txt\nfile and prints the\nCrawl-Delay\nparameter for the User Agent\n*\n, i.e., 30 seconds. If we can afford to wait for 30 seconds between two request, it's better to just do that.\nUsing Proxies\nWebsites often block IP addresses that make too many requests in a short period. But imagine having a whole fleet of ships (IP addresses) at our command. That's what proxies are!\nInstead of just one ship sending out requests, we can spread the load across many, making it harder for websites to detect us.\nRotating Proxies:\nThis is like sending our ships from different ports, making it look like a bunch of different users are accessing the website. This is especially useful for high-volume scraping.\nResidential Proxies:\nThese proxies use IP addresses provided by ISPs to homeowners, making them appear as real users.\nPro Tip:\nI've found that a mix of both proxy types provides a good balance between cost and effectiveness.\nSetting or Rotating User Agents\nImagine showing up to a party in a disguise - each time a different one. That's what rotating user agents does. By changing the\nUser-Agent\nheader in our HTTP requests, we can mimic requests from different browsers and devices.\nRandom User Agents:\nWe can have a whole chest full of different hats (user agents) and pick a new one for each request.\nCustom User Agents:\nWe can even create our own special eyepatches (custom user agents) to look super unique, with details like browser versions, operating systems, and other details to further disguise our scraper.\nUndetected ChromeDriver\nSome websites are really smart and can spot headless browsers like\nSelenium\n. But there is a secret weapon: the undetected ChromeDriver!\nIt helps in running Chrome in a headless mode while avoiding detection by websites that block scrapers.\nInstallation:\nUse libraries like\nundetected-chromedriver\nthat automatically configures ChromeDriver to evade detection\nCustomization:\nModify Chrome options to mimic real user behavior, such as setting a realistic screen resolution and enabling JavaScript\nNo Driver\nNoDriver is an asynchronous tool that replaces traditional components such as Selenium or webdriver binaries, providing direct communication with browsers. This approach not only reduces the detection rate by most anti-bot solutions but also significantly improves the tool's performance.\nThis package has a unique feature that sets it apart from other similar packages - it is optimized to avoid detection by most anti-bot solutions.\nCheck out our tutorial on\nHow to scrape websites with Nodriver\n.\nBalancing Act\nWeb scraping is like a delicate dance - too aggressive, and we'll be blocked; too timid, and we won't get the data we need. By using proxies, rotating user agents, leveraging undetected ChromeDriver, and avoiding drivers when possible, we can strike the perfect balance.\nRemember, it's not just about getting the data but doing so efficiently and ethically.\nFor more tips and tricks, don't forget to check out our article on\nweb scraping without getting blocked\n.\nConclusion\nHere's a quick recap table of every technology we discussed in this tutorial.\nName\nEase of Use\nFlexibility\nSpeed of Execution\nCommon Use Case\nLearn More\nSocket\n- - -\n+ + +\n+ + +\nWriting low-level programming interfaces\nOfficial documentation\nUrllib3\n+ +\n+ + +\n+ +\nHigh-level applications needing fine control over HTTP (pip, aws client, requests, streaming)\nOfficial documentation\nRequests\n+ + +\n+ +\n+ +\nCalling APIs, Simple applications (in terms of HTTP needs)\nOfficial documentation\nAsyncio\n+ +\n+ +\n+ + +\nAsynchronous scraping, high-speed concurrent requests\nOfficial documentation\nScrapy\n+ +\n+ + +\n+ + +\nCrawling numerous websites, Filtering, extracting, and loading scraped data\nOfficial documentation\nSelenium\n+\n+ + +\n+\nJS rendering, Scraping SPAs, Automated testing, Programmatic screenshots\nOfficial documentation\nWeb Content API\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+ + +\nDirectly accessing structured data from APIs\nPraw documentation\nScrapingBee\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+ + +\nHeadless browser scraping, bypassing anti-bot measures, handling JavaScript-heavy pages\nOfficial documentation\nWe\u2019ve covered quite a lot of ground in this blog post, from the basics of socket programming to advanced web scraping with Selenium and everything in between.
