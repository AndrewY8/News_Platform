Suhasini Chandramouli

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded.

Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.

Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Additional information will also be in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2025 to be filed tomorrow and in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Tim Cook

Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting $95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year.

We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it.

And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas.

During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states.

Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone.

Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design.

Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color.

The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and get more done.

Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations.

Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design.

Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care.

Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India starting later this year.

Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day.

With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year.

It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching their favorite teams go to bat on Friday Night Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app.

Turning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI.

At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private Cloud Compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI.

Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features from helpful Writing Tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, Clean Up, Visual Intelligence and a seamless connection to ChatGPT, we made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail, messages and more.

We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands.

Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online.

We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030.

Now let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter.

However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates.

As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements.

With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.

Kevan Parekh

Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.

Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily driven by favorable mix.

Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion.

Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as measured by 451 Research.

Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S.

iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S.

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago quarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%.

Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year.

Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year.

Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in Latin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees.

With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers.

Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares.

Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2025.

As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call.

We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

With that, let's open the call to questions.

Suhasini Chandramouli

We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Erik Woodring

Great, thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the U.S. currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the U.S. to be by the end of your fiscal year? And is it the goal to source 100% of your U.S.-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.

Tim Cook

Yes, Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that contain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.

Erik Woodring

Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank you, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. So can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter? If you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide? And ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim.

Tim Cook

Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. So I hope that makes the -- answers all your questions.

Erik Woodring

Thank you so much, Tim. Good Luck.

Tim Cook

Thanks.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Erik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.

Ben Reitzes

Hi, thanks a lot. Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel-ish a quarter at 900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. But then you did make a comment about after the June quarter, and sorry to push you on that, but could it be a multiple of that figure or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June. And if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller or what? And hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks.

Tim Cook

Yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier.

Ben Reitzes

All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks.

Tim Cook

Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there.

Ben Reitzes

Thanks a lot, Tim.

Tim Cook

Yes. Thank you, Ben.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Ng

Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation? And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue? Thank you.

Tim Cook

Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.

Michael Ng

Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you.

Kevan Parekh

Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange.

Michael Ng

Thank you.

Kevan Parekh

Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.

Amit Daryanani

Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter? And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially?

Tim Cook

I wouldn't want to go through all of them. But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful.

Amit Daryanani

Got it. And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?

Kevan Parekh

Yes, Amit. Hi, it's Kevan. So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today.

Amit Daryanani

Got it. Thank you.

Kevan Parekh

Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan

Yes. Thank you. Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up?

Tim Cook

We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. And that's the SoC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know.

Kevan Parekh

Yes, maybe I'll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units revenue margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies. We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. So I hope that's helpful color and context for you.

Wamsi Mohan

No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has like actually happened?

Tim Cook

It's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. And so it's -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter.

Wamsi Mohan

Okay. Thank you, Tim.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.

David Vogt

Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? And I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks.

Tim Cook

In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply. And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question.

Kevan Parekh

Hi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today.

David Vogt

Okay. But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?

Kevan Parekh

I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.

David Vogt

Okay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys.

Kevan Parekh

Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Samik Chatterjee

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out. Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.

Tim Cook

Yes, thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3.

Samik Chatterjee

Okay, got it. Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer? And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you.

Tim Cook

I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level. And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. And so that's all I want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.

Samik Chatterjee

Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.

Tim Cook

Yes.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Krish Sankar

Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that? How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into like the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona? Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.

Tim Cook

Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner. We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well. And so it's a bit of all of it.

Krish Sankar

Got it, got it. And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge. Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference? Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device? Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here.

Tim Cook

Yes. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today. And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT. And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.

Krish Sankar

Thanks, sir.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.

Richard Kramer

Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack? Or is it a matter of R&D spending? And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC? Thanks.

Tim Cook

Yes. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18. And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on. And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. So we've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. And there's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.

Kevan Parekh

And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D. That continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment. And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map.

Richard Kramer

Thanks. And Kevan, 1 for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google antitrust trial touching on default search. And investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your Services business. Do you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple Services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?

Tim Cook

Let me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. And so we're monitoring these closely. But there -- as you point out, there's risk associated with them and the outcome is unclear.

Kevan Parekh

Yes, I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that.

Richard Kramer

Thank you.

Suhasini Chandramouli

Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please.

Operator

We'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Aaron Rakers

Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. And I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. And kind of dovetailed with that is that, how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, 3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that. How does the strategy play out in your opinion?

Tim Cook

Well, we -- on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. And so we utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. And as I've mentioned in the 500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. And so we do plan on making investments in that area and we're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models and we'll partner as well. And so I don't view it as a -- all of one or all of the other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the Private Cloud Compute.

Aaron Rakers

Yes. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious with the iPhone 16e launching this quarter, internalizing your C1 modem, I'm curious of how you see kind of the modem strategy playing out or maybe just the continual deepening of that internal silicon opportunity for Apple?

Tim Cook

We're super excited to ship the first 1 and get it out there and it's gone well. We love that we can produce better products from a point of view of really focusing on battery life and other things that customers want. And so we're -- we have started on a journey is the way I would put it.

Aaron Rakers

Thank you.

Tim Cook

Yes.

Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Ambrish Srivastava, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.

Ambrish Srivastava

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Irving Tan, Western Digital's Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, Western Digital's Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

In our prepared remarks, our comments will be related to non-GAAP results on a continuing operations basis, unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.wdc.com.

Lastly, I want to note that when we refer to we, us, our, or similar terms, we are referring only to Western Digital as a company and not speaking on behalf of the industry.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Irving for introductory remarks. Irving?

Tiang Yew Tan

Thanks, Ambrish. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me first begin by welcoming and introducing Kris Sennesael, our new Chief Financial Officer. Kris brings extensive experience and a strong track record as a public company CFO. His leadership will be instrumental as we sharpen our focus on operational execution, accelerate our capital return program and continue to create value for our shareholders. We are excited to have Kris on board.

Let me now walk you through our business update. AI is ushering in the new era of data growth by fundamentally transforming how data is created, collected, processed and stored and more importantly, value. Looking beyond large language models, which have been a key driver of storage needs, the emergence of Agentic AI at scale in multiple industries is creating an increasing need to store unstructured data. Agents customized with the main specific knowledge will create a significant amount of distinct use cases, and generate data at an unprecedented pace.

To set a few examples; applications leveraging Agentic AI range from business tools like enterprise chatbots and court development assistance, all the way to agents assisting in engineering, design and development. Within our own engineering organization, we are already realizing tangible benefits of Agentic AI to help accelerate our product development cycles. These trends are still in their early stages but are expanding rapidly across industries globally. As data becomes more valuable and central to AI-driven innovation, the need to store and retain it at scale grows in parallel. And no storage technology matches the cost efficiency and reliability of HDDs, which remain the foundation of the world's data infrastructure, delivering unmatched value for mass storage in an AI-driven future.

Against this backdrop, demand for our products continues to strengthen. We remain disciplined in managing capacity and are addressing long-term market demand through high-quality, reliable and larger capacity products. Shipments of our latest generation ePMR drives with capacity up to 26 terabytes CMR and 32 terabyte UltraSMR more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, exceeding 1.7 million units in the June quarter. This marks one of the shortest qualification and ramp cycles in our history.

The reliability, scalability and TCO value of our ePMR and UltraSMR technologies that delivers the fastest time to value for our customers is core to our continued success in the data center market. We aim to extend ePMR's strong track record of high yield, reliability and a scalable performance into our next generation of HAMR drives. The feedback from tests at 2 of our hyperscale

customers continues to be encouraging. I am pleased to note that we are ahead of our internal milestones with steady progress in aero density improvement and continue to focus on increasing long-term reliability and manufacturing yield of our HAMR products.

Next, we will transition from testing to qualification stage with these customers. Staying well on track for a ramp in the first half of calendar year 2027. Meanwhile, our next generation of ePMR drives will complete qualification in the first half of calendar year 2026. These drives will continue to deliver strong TCO along with the hallmark reliability and predictability, paving the way for a smooth and economically sound transition to HAMR.

In addition, the rapid rise of AI is also accelerating our platforms business. Our platform's technology enables us to deliver dense systems that extract the full performance and capacity of our drive. This business is building traction with infrastructure providers and is well positioned to support the growing number of native AI companies that don't have their own storage infrastructure teams.

Let me now turn to our quarterly results and capital allocation updates. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Western Digital delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.66. Free cash flow for the quarter was $675 million. During the June quarter, we lowered our debt by $2.6 billion via a combination of using cash on hand and a debt-for- equity exchange of a portion of our state incentives. As a result, we have strengthened our balance sheet and achieved a net leverage target range of 1 to 1.5x.

We communicated at our Investor Day in February in less than 2 quarters. Keeping with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, we initiated a quarterly cash dividend program and the Board authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we purchased nearly $150 million worth of shares. Looking ahead, while the broader environment continues to be marked with uncertainty related to tariffs, we are seeing strong demand for our products driven by AI and related tailwinds in our business.

Our visibility into our customers' plans continue to improve and we currently have firm POs or LTAs with all of our top 5 hyperscale customers covering our entire fiscal year 2026. This close collaboration with our customers enables us to plan more effectively and address their growing needs for storage. For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, we expect continued revenue growth driven by data center demand and improved profitability led by adoption of our high-capacity drives.

Let me now turn the call over to Kris, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results and Q1 fiscal year '26 guidance in more detail.

Kris Sennesael

Thank you, Irving, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm honored to be joining you today for my first earnings call as the Chief Financial Officer of Western Digital. Over the past several weeks, I had the opportunity to perform a deep dive into our business and met with many of our valued employees across the company. I also had several meaningful engagements with customers, suppliers and partners and the investor community. It's been a tremendously energizing experience, providing great insight into our strategic, financial and operational priorities.

It's clear to me that Western Digital is now operating as a strategically focused hard disk drive company. The company is leveraging its technology leadership position, operational excellence and deep customer engagements to provide innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of its customers. This provides a strong foundation for growth, profitability and cash flow generation that creates long- term shareholder value.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Western Digital delivered very strong financial results. Revenue was $2.6 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and earnings per share was $1.66. Revenue and EPS were above the high end of the guidance range. We delivered 190 exabytes to our customers, up 32% year-over-year driven by strong nearline shipments and the ramp of our 26 terabytes CMR and 32- terabyte UltraSMR drives.

Cloud represented 90% of total revenue at $2.3 billion, up 36% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our higher capacity in nearline product portfolio. Client represented 5% of total revenue at $140 million, up 2% year-over-year. And consumer also represented 5% of revenue at $136 million, down 12% year-over-year.

Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 41.3%. Gross margin improved 610 basis points year-over-year on a continuing operating basis, and was above our guidance range. The improved gross margin performance reflects continued mix shift towards higher capacity drives and tight cost control in our manufacturing sites and throughout the supply chain.

Operating expenses were $345 million, slightly above guidance due to higher variable compensation on stronger-than-expected results. Operating income was $732 million, translating into an operating margin of 28.1%. Interest and other expenses were $52

million, a substantial reduction from the prior quarter due to the repayment of $2.6 billion of debt during the quarter. Taking into account an effective tax rate of 9.3% and a diluted share count of 362 million shares, EPS was $1.66, up 22% sequentially.

Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, and the total liquidity was $3.4 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity. During the quarter, we exchanged approximately 21 million shares of SanDisk for debt. As a result, our Term Loan A reduced by $800 million, and we still own 7.5 million shares of SanDisk. In addition, we redeemed $1.8 billion of the senior unsecured notes, resulting in gross debt outstanding of $4.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2025. We strengthened our balance sheet and achieved our target net leverage ratio of 1 to 1.5x as outlined at our Investor Day.

Operating cash flow for the fiscal fourth quarter was $746 million, and capital expenditures were $71 million, resulting in strong free cash flow generation of $675 million for the quarter. Backed by strong cash flow generation, a robust balance sheet and confidence in the fundamentals of our business, the Board authorized up to $2 billion of share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares for a total of $149 million. In addition, as announced during the last earnings call, the Board initiated a cash dividend of $0.10 per share resulting in $36 million of dividend payments during the quarter. The Board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of the company's common stock payable on September 18, 2025, to shareholders of record as of September 4, 2025.

I will now turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. This guidance includes our current estimate of all anticipated or known tariff-related impacts on our business in this period. We anticipate revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus/minus $100 million. At the midpoint, this reflects a growth of approximately 22% year-over-year. Gross margin is expected to be between 41% and 42%. We expect operating expenses to increase on a sequential basis to a range of $370 million to $380 million, including an additional week of expenses as Q1 will be a 14-week quarter. Interest and other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 19%. As a result, we expect EPS to be $1.54 plus/minus $0.15 based on a non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 363 million shares.

In closing, Western Digital is well positioned to succeed in the AI-driven data economy. We remain committed to meeting our customers' growing storage needs while using our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call back to Irving.

Tiang Yew Tan

Thank you, Kris. Western Digital's strong results and positive outlook this quarter reflects the ongoing successful execution of our strategy and the continued trust our customers place in the performance reliability and TCO advantages of our products. This combination of customer trust, strategic focus and disciplined execution is driving our strong financial results.

With that, let's now begin with the Q&A. Over to you, Ambrish.

Ambrish Srivastava

Thanks, Irving. Operator, you can now open the line to questions, please. To ensure that we hear from as many analysts as possible, please ask 1 question at a time. After we respond, we will give you an opportunity to ask 1 follow-up question. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Erik William Richard Woodring

And congrats on the results tonight. Kris, I wanted to kind of better understand the gross margin guidance for the September quarter. You're calling for, I believe, 20 basis points of sequential gross margin expansion at the midpoint. Can you maybe just help us unpack maybe why we're seeing that sequential gross margin expansion slow into the September quarter, if there are any one-timers or headwinds that are unusual in the quarter to call out? And I'll just ask the follow-up because it's related, which is beyond September, I realize you have a 38% gross margin in your 3-year financial model. As we progress through this up cycle though, how should we be thinking about the incremental margins in this business and maybe help us stream the dream of what's possible during this up cycle?

Kris Sennesael

Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. And so first of all, I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making with our gross margin. As you probably recall, at the February Investor Day, we had -- we announced a business model with a 38% gross margin. And so last quarter, even before I joined the company, I was very pleased to see that the company, for the first time had gross margins with a 4 handle in the 40% range in last quarter in Q4 of fiscal '25. I'm very pleased with the fact that we delivered 41.3% gross margin. So really good progress for many quarters in a row.

As you know, in gross margins, there's multiple elements that go into it. There is pricing, the risk mix, the risk cost. And in each of those fronts, I think the company is executing really well. Pricing is very stable environment. The mix is shifting in the right direction to higher capacity drives that is accretive to gross margins and the operational team is executing really well, driving down cost reductions in the factories as well throughout the supply chain. And so I do believe there is further gross margin progression. We guided now Q1 of fiscal '26 to 41% to 42%. I'm confident that the team will execute well and continue to focus on further gross margin improvements over time.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers

I do have 2 and I'll wait to ask a follow-up. I guess the first question, Kris, congrats on the results as well. But you've taken the debt down, you're well within your targeted range of 1 to 1.5 on a leverage ratio basis, strong free cash flow generation, you've got $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I'm curious as you start to think about share repurchase activity going forward, how should we as investors think about that? Or how do you think about excess cash generation or the right level of cash on the balance sheet that you'll operate the business at or rather the capacity for even stepping further on share repurchase going forward?

Kris Sennesael

Yes, Aaron, that's a great question. And here again, I'm really pleased with what I've seen in the company as well in terms of capital, capital structure and capital allocation. And just to summarize it as well, there is very strong free cash flow. Just last quarter, the first quarter as the stand-alone hardest drive company, we generated $675 million of free cash flow which was a 26% free cash flow margin. Now not each and every quarter will be as strong as last quarter, but the business model is really a strong free cash flow business model.

In addition to that, the company has done a great job at strengthening the balance sheet at the time of the separation as well as last quarter where we retired $2.6 billion of debt now getting to a net debt of $2.6 billion, which is on or about onetime LTM EBITDA. So really good job there. And so there's no hesitation from the Board, to the management team to continue to return cash back to the shareholders through a combination of our dividend program and the share repurchase program.

The dividend program, we started with $0.10 per quarter. I think there is room to grow that dividend over time. We're going to be very thoughtful about that, but there was also no hesitation to switch on the buyback. The day it got approved. You saw we did $150 million. I think over time, as the cash flow generation continues to grow, we can do more, and there will be no hesitation to execute the share repurchase program.

Ambrish Srivastava

Do you have a follow-up, Erik? Aaron, sorry.

Aaron Christopher Rakers

Yes, I do, Ambrish. One of the metrics that you guys have historically given and helps kind of bridge the hard disk drive versus the non-hard disk drive business was the ASP. I didn't see that in tonight's release. So I'm curious if that's something that you could talk to? Or I guess, maybe put another way, how do we think about the non-HDD revenue in this most recent quarter?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. Aaron, thanks for the question. This is Irving. Obviously, ASP per terabyte is obviously a function of mix by and large. But I would say for last quarter, ASP per terabyte was down low single digits.

Operator

The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan

And congrats on your solid results as well. Could you maybe help us think a little bit longer term here? When you look at sort of the revenue contribution, 90% coming from cloud, does it really mean that the seasonality in the business is going to be materially different? And what I'm particularly wondering is, should we be thinking that you're just going to see sequential growth as demand is kind of strong, still all indications of cloud CapEx remained very strong that you could grow through even typically a seasonal weaker quarter like the March quarter? And I have a follow-up.

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Look, I think you sort of got it well in the sense that we are structurally quite a different business today than we were in the past. As you highlighted, 90% of our business is in the data center. A large portion of that business is driven by a few set of key hyperscale customers that we have. They have multiyear CapEx programs to really invest in their data storage assets, both to support the ongoing growth in the cloud and to also support the additional tailwind that they see coming from the AI revolution as well.

So that, plus the fact that we also now have moved to a 52-week lead time program with them. And as we've highlighted, we have POs all LTAs for all 5 of our top customers spending the entire fiscal year '26 and for 2 out of 5 of them, all the way to the middle of fiscal year '27, we don't think that the seasonality of the past applies anymore. It's really driven by the cloud CapEx spend of the big hyperscalers in terms of their new data center deployments, the refresh cycles as well.

Having said that, we do recognize that we are in a cyclical business. At some point, those cycles, there will be periods of digestion, as we highlighted in our Q3 results as well, but we pretty much have a really good handle on how the business is slowing over a 12-, 18-month time frame. But if I summarize it, you got it pretty right. The traditional seasonality of the past doesn't really apply to this business a lot more. It's really driven by the programs that our hyperscale customers have in terms of new data centers coming online in their refresh cycles.

Wamsi Mohan

Okay. That's super helpful, Irving. And as my follow-up, Kris, I just wanted to go back to the incremental margin question that Erik asked around, and you answered with the moving pieces being price, mix and cost. So if we think about the sequential improvement in this June quarter of 120 bps, what would you say was the biggest driver between those 3 elements. And as we look forward, where

do you see the most opportunity? I would think that the pricing is what it's going to be. It's pretty stable. It's kind of not maybe a huge incremental driver. So should we think that mix is really the biggest kind of contributor on a go-forward basis as you mix up these UltraSMR drives? Or should I be thinking about it differently?

Kris Sennesael

No. You have it right. Mix is the most important item that we, as a company, focus on. That's why we continue to invest in our technology and product road maps and really focusing on higher capacity drives. That is something that our customers are asking us for. That's something we are working and collaborating with our customers on, and it's a win-win situation. For us, higher capacity drives typically translates into higher gross margin. And the company is executing really well on that.

Maybe Wamsi, this is Irving. I'll just add on to what Kris said. So I echo exactly what I said it's really driven very much by mix. And you would have seen that our latest generation of ePMR drives a 26-terabyte CMR and 32-terabyte UltraSMR, the number of units that we shipped doubled in the second quarter, up from just over 800,000 units in last quarter to over 1.7 million units this quarter. That's a clear recognition of our customers seeing the TCO value that it delivers, the strong reliability that it delivers to -- and quality that they are comfortable and used to from our ePMR drives.

And as I've highlighted in the past as well, these drives are not only at the leading edge of capacity points, where the ability of our operations teams deliver very high yields is also adding to the profitability of that business. And we look forward to introducing our next-generation ePMR drives in the not-too-distant future. So I think there will be continued room to continue to deliver value, innovation TCO benefit that we can benefit from and drive further margin expansion.

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.

Karl Ackerman

So one of the main ways you have driven higher margins is from the adoption of UltraSMR, and I was hoping if you could discuss the adoption curve and willingness of hyperscalers to grow their hard drive base exclusively on UltraSMR. I guess, is there a certain workload -- are there certain workloads where UltraSMR is disadvantaged that would prevent you from attaining perhaps 100% of your fleet on UltraSMR?

Tiang Yew Tan

Karl, thanks for the question. Well, we have, in the past, had 2 key customers on UltraSMR. We've just completed the qualification of a third hyperscale customer out of our top 5 on UltraSMR and just starting to ramp UltraSMR in the second half of the calendar year. We now have a fourth customer in the process of qualifying UltraSMR as well. And again, to reiterate, it's very important to note that UltraSMR is a technology that will be extensible into HAMR as well. As we transition into our HAMR products in the not-too-distant future, we will be able to deliver that on the UltraSMR platforms as well to enable our customers to take advantage of the incremental capacity points within that.

Specifically, your question around workloads. It really depends on the application. So even in the existing customer environments that do use UltraSMR today, there are some specific legacy workloads that they buy lower capacity drives, 18, 20 terabyte drives. But what we are seeing is that for any new workloads that they are bringing to the market, it's all on the highest capacity points that they can adopt, which is typically on UltraSMR.

Ambrish Srivastava

Do you have a follow-up, Karl?

Karl Ackerman

I do, if I may. So you and your peer have seen the strongest visibility in terms of order rates and really the longest time ever. That clearly speaks to the demand requests from hyperscale customers. Clearly, they would love to have you add capacity given the longer lead times and the sophistication of these customers, how do you balance the visibility with those customers as well as the demand request for those customers as you plan your capacity playing and they could plan their hyperscale build-outs for the next 2 years?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. It's a great question. So on the demand signal, I think the first step was really to educate our customers on the long lead times as the products become much more sophisticated as we move to higher capacity drives. We have highlighted and they're aware that really the long lead times are driven by the hit wafers that we have to produce that take roughly 9 months to produce a head wafer and then a 3 months to convert them into headstack. So 1 year lead time on that component alone, and that's been instrumental in driving us to that 12-month LTE visibility. We are now also having conversations with them, as I've highlighted with 2 of them, we now have 18 months visibility.

So that really is a key in terms of that partnership to get greater visibility to support their growth requirements. That's giving us a lot of insight into how we need to accelerate our aerial density improvements in our products. That also is a function of why you saw the very rapid take-up of our latest generation of ePMR drives. I think we will see something very similar in our next generation of ePMR drives out very soon as well. But again, the focus is on really delivering increased aerial density to our customers, through technologies like UltraSMR, OptiNAND. And if there's any investment that we do need to make into capacity, it's really on the head and media side of our business to support aerial density improvement.

Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.

Asiya Merchant

I think in the last call, there was some discussion on tariffs and some potential for enterprise slowdown. Just curious if you have anything to suggest there any updates there? And how do we make sure -- how do we -- how are you making sure that some of this demand is not just related to tariff pull forward?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. Thanks, Asiya, for the question. I guess there are 2 parts to the question. First, on the enterprise demand. We called it out as a risk with the potential concern that the impact of tariffs might have. We haven't seen that materialize. So obviously, the tariffs, some of the reciprocal tariffs got pushed out as well. So we haven't seen that yet. But again, as I highlighted, some of the potential softness in enterprise, which didn't materialize, we would pick up in the cloud anyway because enterprises will move from CapEx to consumption-based models. So we sort of netted off regardless, but we haven't seen any of that risk materialize.

To your second question about tariffs, it's a very fluid and dynamic situation. But we don't see any double ordering based on the analysis that we've done. We look at in quarter linearity trends and they're very similar to what we've seen historically. We compare that against the 12-month lead times that our customers have given us either through firm POs or through LTAs and they're pretty much matching those same projections to the T.

And last but not least, we're in a very, very tight supply environment. So our ability to deliver upside within a quarter is also very limited. For those reasons and the fact that we do monitor our customer inventory levels the best we can. We don't see any pull forwards as a result of tariffs as of now.

Ambrish Srivastava

Thank you for your 2 questions, Asiya. We go to the next caller please.

The next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.

Thomas James O'Malley

I just wanted to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys said ASPs in the June quarter were down low single digits. Is that correct?

Tiang Yew Tan

So Tom, so ASPs per drive continue to go up as we move to higher capacity drives but ASP per terabyte was slightly down, but mostly driven by mix because the price environment is very stable.

Thomas James O'Malley

Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, if you look at the market today. I think that your competitor had talked about an exabyte target where after that certain target, I think they said around 160 exabytes, they would need to see growth really exclusively from technology transitions. I asked you last quarter, but in terms of where you guys stand, is there any mark that you would call out as that kind of waterfall? Is there a spot that you would say from this point forward, we only need technology transitions to move forward just in your ability to capacity kind of constrain the market? Anything you have there?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. Tom, I would say that if you look at the last quarter, we delivered 190 exabytes, and that's really a result of the latest generation of ePMR drives that we've delivered. So our ability to not only produce higher capacity drives, vulnerability to produce them at scale with high yields, I think, has really differentiated us. And so we look -- we are laser-focused on continuing to ensure we have high yields of our components, our drives and continuing to deliver products to our customers at scale. So as a result of that, we don't have to make any incremental investments into capacity.

Operator

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani

I guess maybe to start with, I was hoping you folks would spend a bit of time on talking about how does the extra week flow through your P&L and on the revenue and OpEx side? And what's the right OpEx run rate to think about beyond that extra week?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. On the revenue side, our customers, they think in quarterly buckets in line with their long-term forecasts and LTAs, and POs that they have placed. So we don't really see much on the revenue side. There might be a little bit of a benefit in the consumer retail side of the business. But as you know, that's relatively small for Western Digital. On the OpEx side, however, it is an extra week. It's, I would say, it's on or about $15 million, $1-5 million of incremental spend that happens in Q1 of fiscal '26. Obviously, looking ahead to Q2, Q3, Q4, that comes out of it as those quarters are normal 13-week quarters.

Ambrish Srivastava

Do you have a follow-up, Amit?

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani

I do. Irving, you initially having spoken a good bit about Agentic AI deployment and how that could drive demand for HDDs. If I think about your Analyst Day, you talked about like 20% exabyte growth, mid- to high single-digit revenue growth for the company. As you start to see AI getting deployed, I'm wondering how do you think those numbers can move higher? And if there is way to quantify what kind of tailwind this would provide for your business longer term?

Tiang Yew Tan

Yes. Thanks, Amit, for the question. Yes, if you recall what we presented at Investor Day was a base model that 15 exabyte growth. That was primarily driven by the sort of secular growth in the cloud, and we highlighted the potential upside of that 15 exabyte CAGR

growth to 23% as a result of an AI uplift. We are starting to see some of that uplift materialize. So it's still early days, but we think that the exabyte growth is more between the 15% to 23% range rather than the base number that we've highlighted. In that model that we presented at Investor Day, we also had a 7% ASP decline. As Kris highlighted, we're seeing a much lower ASP decline in the low single digits as well.

So as we see exabyte growth trend more to that level and ASP is in the low single digits. There's definitely opportunity for revenue growth from a CAGR perspective to go from the sort of mid- to high single-digit range that we have highlighted at Investor Day to trend more towards the mid-teens. And if you take that mid-teens revenue growth with the OpEx levels that we've highlighted, we will probably be at an OpEx level of 10% of OpEx to revenue. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of bridging what we shared at Investor Day and the changing outlook that we see in the business as a result of the AI tailwinds that we're beginning to highlight.

Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.

Ananda Prosad Baruah

2 if I could, I'll do one and then one. Could you -- Irving, could you remind us of the aerial density road map from here until HAMR? And where do you think HAMR -- where do you think you come out aerial density-wise, let's say you sort of execute to the first half 2020 -- calendar year 2027 road map. Where do you think your aerial density lies there? So the road map up to that point and then where do you think you come out of that with HAMR?

Tiang Yew Tan

Sure. No problem. Also, our current ePMR product that we've brought into the marketplace is a 26-terabyte CMR, 32-terabyte UltraSMR. We have highlighted in our road map, but we look to start qualification for our next generation of ePMR, which will be our final generation of ePMR in the first half of calendar year 2016. That will be a 28-terabyte CMR, 36-terabyte UltraSMR. And then we will start qualification of HAMR in the second half of calendar year '27 with ramp in the first half of '27 -- calendar year '27. That will be at the 38 terabytes CMR, 44 terabyte UltraSMR. As we've highlighted in the past, we feel the 4 terabyte per platter or if you assume a 10-disk drive, 40 terabyte drive, 4 terabytes per platter is sort of where we see things as of now, the economic crossover where it makes economic sense to transition to HAMR.

Ambrish Srivastava

Do you have a follow-up, Ananda?

Ananda Prosad Baruah

I do, Ambrish. And really more of a clarification. You guys mentioned the Platforms business and opportunity to sell dense systems into native by AI companies, don't have their own infrastructure. Are those the neo cloud? Is that what you're talking about? And then how many of those -- like -- and if yes, like what's a useful way to think about which of that cadre may not have their own infrastructure change? I'd imagine some of the larger ones do. So just in a useful context would be helpful.

Tiang Yew Tan

Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll give you some insight. We actually do have really 1 large cloud provider that's buying platforms from us today that's being deployed at scale. We also have quite a significant number of Storage as a Service providers that are leveraging our platforms business as well to deliver those services to customers. And as you've highlighted, a lot of the neo clouds, their primary focus is really on driving compute capabilities, supporting their customers with their LLM development and then really looking at how they can either leverage the cloud. Or our platform like systems to really support their storage requirements going forward. So we think there's a lot of legs to this business.

Obviously, it's early days. and very similar to what we saw in the cloud, it starts with compute and then eventually it will come down to storage as we saw even in AI in the mainstream cloud where it was GPUs first, HBMs, DRAMs and then eventually, we are seeing that flow through to storage. We think that sort of trend will play itself out in the neo cloud as well and be very beneficial for our platforms business.

And our last questioner today will come from Mark Miller with the Benchmark Company.

Mark S. Miller

I'm just wondering, could you actually quantify the hard drive ASPs in the quarter?

Ambrish Srivastava

Sorry, what's the question?

Mark S. Miller

What were your hard drive ASPs in the June quarter?

Ambrish Srivastava

You mean unit?

Mark S. Miller

The average selling price -- yes, for hard drives.

Ambrish Srivastava

Yes. So we -- as you see the disclosures. This is Ambrish. We have stopped providing ASP per unit because as Irving highlighted earlier, that what's more important for our business is EP. And so just to give you a context of why we changed and what we are providing now. Kris, do you want to add to that?

Kris Sennesael

Yes. And I think we provided the units. And so I think it's -- you can easily do the math, and you will see, I think, a substantial sequential as well as year-over-year growth in our revenue per drive that we have. But again, it's -- a lot of it depends on the mix of our overall revenue, and so for me, that number is somewhat meaningful. Yes, it's trending upwards, again, mostly driven by the move to higher capacity drives, something that we work with our customers on.

Mark S. Miller

And just finally, DSOs for the quarter ?

Kris Sennesael

DSO? I don't have it on top of my head, but we did -- as a company, we did a really good job at managing our working capital. I'm very comfortable with the level of inventory that we have right now, which is on or about $ 1.3 billion that translate into days of inventory of 76 days. And then the DSOs came down, I believe, 6 days on a sequential basis and is now at 52 days. So again, really, as you know, DSOs is mostly driven by the billing finality within the quarter. And as Irving indicated that before, that continues to be very strong as well.
