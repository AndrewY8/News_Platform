Amazon expects total net sales to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion in the third quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $173.08 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Amazon said it expected second-half spending roughly the same as its second quarter total of $31.4 billion, suggesting it would spend\u00a0around $118 billion for the full year. Analysts had said Amazon's focus on low prices, quick delivery and its many product categories\u00a0helped cement its position as the No. 1 e-commerce retailer for U.S. consumers, giving it an edge over rivals.",

CEO Andy Jassy told analysts on a post-earnings call that it was still \"very early days\" in the AI race and that Amazon's massive cloud business, much larger than rivals, was primed to perform well once the AI capacity constraints start to ease.
